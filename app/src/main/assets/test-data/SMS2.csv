+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 8:46 PM	Yes	Tonight has been ridiculously shitty
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	Please complain to me. I need to know someone else is having a shitty day 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 8:48 PM	Yes	Not sure if you are being sarcastic?
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	No I'm not. Promise 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 8:54 PM	Yes	You'd rather not hear about it, it's damn depressing, I'd love to hear about your day though
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 8:53 PM	No	Naw you first 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 8:57 PM	Yes	I'm dealing with a drunk and suicidal friend, who wants his keys back so he can go home and shoot himself, and I don't know what to do other than try to get him to go to bed
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	You have to get him to bed. Or stick him in the shower and try to get him to sober up. Are you at your house?
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 9:02 PM	Yes	No, and he is sobering up, your turn, I want to think about something else
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:03 PM	No	Okay. I'll just rant? 
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:03 PM	No	But Sam wants to go to formal with me right? He didn't just feel bad for me?
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 9:08 PM	Yes	Rantings fine, and why wouldn't he want to take you? Heck I'm jealous of him
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	Na it's fine. It's not worth it to rant. Connor? Jealous? I'm flattered 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 9:15 PM	Yes	Really feel free to rant, and you probably should feel that a little bit
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	I just feel a little used. But what else is knew? Oh I'm super flattered. 
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	But I'm really fine. I'm way better off 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 9:21 PM	Yes	It's starting to get a little better, why do you feel used?
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	What's getting better? Na I mean everything was perfectly fine Saturday night. I always think these guys like me but I think they just like themselves a lot more 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 9:28 PM	Yes	My friend, and at this stage that's probably the truth Hannah, did it ever occur to you that he may have broke it off because he was insecure?
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	Oh good. I'm glad to hear that. Where are y'all? He told me our conversations were forced and awkward. You think he's insecure? 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 9:42 PM	Yes	Gabo's, and I don't know, it's just a possibility, one that you can probably feel better about yourself believing
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	Are you drunk? Yeah. Maybe thinking that will make me not feel like a dummy. 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 9:45 PM	Yes	No, just really tired, and probably not, but thinking your the problem when you aren't isn't the way to do it Hannah 
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:47 PM	No	You don't know I wasn't the problem! 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 9:53 PM	Yes	You don't know that you were, so why beat yourself up over it?
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	Yeah you're right. Thank you 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:01 PM	Yes	I typically am, hey I just had to reset my phone and lost Corinne's number
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:02 PM	Yes	+1 (336) 971-5457\LF
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:02 PM	Yes	Is that it?
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 10:01 PM	No	Yes! I think she's going to text and ask about formal plans and causally start a conversation? 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:18 PM	Yes	Haha good, cause we really need to get to know each other some, quick question, someone just told me Corrine is into Sam?
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:33 PM	Yes	Not really, I wouldn't put up much of a fight, what's going to be far more awkward is that she wants to hang out with you and maddie before hand, maddie for obvious reasons, and you because Sam doesn't want to pay for a nice dinner, which I'm planning on having
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	Wow. Tell Sam I'm offended
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:45 PM	Yes	Will do, not going to make your dinner any nicer though
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 10:46 PM	No	Ugh fuck me 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:51 PM	Yes	Sam and I can just trade, than you get good food
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 11:08 PM	No	Hey do I need to get a boutteneire or however you spell it
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:10 PM	Yes	You are absolutely right, the first part not the Sam thing, and I don't know, I'm getting a corsage 
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 11:13 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:19 PM	Yes	I try
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 11:22 PM	No	That's what I'm worried about..
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:23 PM	Yes	?
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	Nothin
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:25 PM	Yes	That's not gonna work
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	My nothing won't work?
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:25 PM	Yes	Yes, it won't work
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 11:26 PM	No	I was being sarcastic which I guess maybe be awkward for some people....
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 11:26 PM	No	Kidding. And that was a bitchy comment 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:28 PM	Yes	No it wasn't and your being evasive, that won't work, you were making a point, what was it?
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 11:32 PM	No	I was just being a smart ass about if you really try 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:50 PM	Yes	Oh, that's fair
+13366719609	Jan 28, 2014, 11:51 PM	No	I usually am 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:03 AM	Yes	Yeah, why are you awake so late?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 12:07 AM	No	I don't know if I want to tell you that....\LFWhy are you awake so late? 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:08 AM	Yes	But now you've made me want to know
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 12:07 AM	No	
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:11 AM	Yes	Haha that's nothing to be ashamed of, what are you watching?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 12:14 AM	No	Haha it's embarrassing I'm\LFnot doing anything else. Friday night lights 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:28 AM	Yes	Haha it's not as embarrassing as the fact that I love that show
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 12:32 AM	No	Haha that makes me laugh. It's a good show!
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:44 AM	Yes	It's a great show, how far along are you?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 12:57 AM	No	Halfway through the third season! I guess you watched the whole thing?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 1:11 AM	Yes	Of course, it was a while back though
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 10:10 AM	No	Yeah I think Tim Riggins is my favorite
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:20 AM	Yes	Yeah, you'll like him a lot more after you finish the show, his brother sucks
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 10:21 AM	No	Yeah billy scares me a bit 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:44 AM	Yes	Yeah he's going to be really frustrating the next two seasons
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 10:46 AM	No	
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 11:46 AM	Yes	It was good, and not really but I don't know what to do about it
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 11:51 AM	No	Is it bad enough to say something to his parents? 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 11:52 AM	Yes	He hates his parents, and I don't think they'd handle it we'll
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 11:55 AM	No	I think you need to tell someone though right? 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:19 PM	Yes	Yeah I agree, not sure who though, are you at Meredith's?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 12:20 PM	No	Yeno. Those people are probably not going to speak to me again. You're not there?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:31 PM	Yes	Nah, I wasn't invited, why wouldn't they speak to you again?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 12:31 PM	No	Oh I'm sure they were only nice to me because of Alex 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 1:02 PM	Yes	I'm sure that's not true
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 1:11 PM	No	It kind of is but it's fine. I don't really care 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 1:23 PM	Yes	I think you do, and I think that your wrong, it's just going to take some time for them to invite both of you because it's awkward for the two of you to be together, that will pass
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 1:25 PM	No	I'll be fine:) thank you though 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 1:34 PM	Yes	I know
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 1:40 PM	No	I will be. You talk to Corinne?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 2:04 PM	Yes	Yup, we're talking right now
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 2:05 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 3:21 PM	Yes	How do you make those?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 3:24 PM	No	Do you have emojis? 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 3:50 PM	Yes	I don't even know
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	Hit the little globe button on your keyboard and see what pops up 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 4:04 PM	Yes	Don't have one
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 4:05 PM	No	Okay I think you have to either turn it on under settings or download the app 
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 4:05 PM	No	I'm awkwardly sitting here because there's no elliptical open at the Y
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 4:07 PM	Yes	So do something else? Which y do you swole at?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 4:07 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 7:19 PM	Yes	Hannah, Eric and I want to go to fratellis before formal, are you and Sam in?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 7:31 PM	No	Maybe you should ask Sam...I haven't talked to him 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 7:35 PM	Yes	Maybe
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	Maybe ask him??
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 7:38 PM	Yes	Yeah, maybe I'll ask him
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 7:39 PM	Yes	What emotion does that reflect?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	So many 
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	I don't even know where to start 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 7:42 PM	Yes	That's what I thought
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	Wow you're perceptive 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 7:56 PM	Yes	Yes, I'm finally about to submit my last college application
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 7:58 PM	No	That's exciting!! Where to?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 8:12 PM	Yes	Michigan, and I just discovered I have another 500 word essay to write :(
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 8:13 PM	Yes	And I'm not feeling that tonight
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Yeah that sucks. Majorly. I haven't done anything today 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 8:16 PM	Yes	Yeah me either, my motivation is less than zero  at the moment
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	Hahah I'm falling apart 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 8:29 PM	Yes	Haha I feel ya, sam is in for  fratellis

+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 8:40 PM	No	Not the food dummy 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 8:41 PM	Yes	Haha I know that you weren't using fun to describe food Hannah 
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	Okay good. Glad we are on the same page 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 8:51 PM	Yes	Not sure id say we're on the same page
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 8:52 PM	No	Any not?

+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	I get to stay in my sweats and poison my mind with more Friday night lights 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	You mean emotionally satisfy your mind
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	Hey do you think anyone else will want to come to fratellis?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	exactly. Tim Riggins crying was probably the most beautiful thing I've ever seen 
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	I don't know....people were talking about getting a huge group but I'm not sure
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	I'll let you be in charge of that
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:27 PM	Yes	Alright, yeah I think we just won't go with the big group
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:27 PM	Yes	I didn't realize you were so sensitive Hannah 
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:28 PM	No	That is perfectly fine with me.  
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	Yeah. What can I say? I'm pretty emotional when it comes to Riggins 
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:37 PM	No	Turn on American idol now. 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:41 PM	Yes	Why do I need to do that?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	You missed him 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:42 PM	Yes	I missed who?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	The guy auditioning 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:43 PM	Yes	What was special about him?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	He was so goooood 
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	And 16
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:04 PM	Yes	Good like you?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	Dude. No one can be better than me. But he was far more attractive. Can't believe you missed it 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:20 PM	Yes	Sounds like he and I have a lot in common, not vocally but in terms of physical appeal
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:26 PM	Yes	Haha at least i didn't claim to be a great singer
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 10:27 PM	No	I'm an excellent singer!!! 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:34 PM	Yes	So you've told me on several occasions
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	Look whenever the band needs me I'll be ready 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:50 PM	Yes	Just keep waiting, how goes the Friday night lights?
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	I'll hold my breath. Good. I got distracted by American idol. But Jason got the job! 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 11:20 PM	Yes	Which one? Hey tell sam that you want to go to fratellis not milners
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	Jason street! What does Sam wanna do?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 11:23 PM	Yes	No which job? And whatever you want to do, which should be fratellis, because it is so much better than milners and everyone really seems to be struggling with that
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 11:22 PM	No	Sports agent. Haha he doesn't care? 
+13366719609	Jan 29, 2014, 11:29 PM	No	We are going to fratellis

+17344782101	Jan 30, 2014, 12:02 AM	Yes	You realize y'all is just me Corinne Eric and Stephanie 
+13366719609	Jan 30, 2014, 12:02 AM	No	Do you think that's okay with Sam? 
+17344782101	Jan 30, 2014, 12:08 AM	Yes	Yeah, as long as you are
+13366719609	Jan 30, 2014, 12:09 AM	No	Yeah he's the one who has to spend the night with me though haha so I want him to be okay with it
+13366719609	Jan 30, 2014, 7:52 PM	No	Don't eat tomorrow

+13366719609	Jan 31, 2014, 7:21 PM	No	Thank you thank you 
+17344782101	Jan 31, 2014, 8:59 PM	Yes	Where the hell is the dream team?
+13366719609	Jan 31, 2014, 8:59 PM	No	Taking pics. Y'all there??
+17344782101	Jan 31, 2014, 9:02 PM	Yes	Hurry the fuck up
+13366719609	Jan 31, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	Leaving. Still in my dress WOOPS
+13366719609	Jan 31, 2014, 9:07 PM	No	Have you started??
+17344782101	Jan 31, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	We are about to start
+13366719609	Jan 31, 2014, 9:07 PM	No	10 mins
+17344782101	Jan 31, 2014, 9:08 PM	Yes	We only have room for one more teammate whichever one of you gets here first is on the team the others not
+13366719609	Jan 31, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	What?!??
+17344782101	Jan 31, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	Hurry the duck up
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 3:51 PM	No	Ian was wondering if he could come to dinner with us 
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 3:51 PM	No	Oh never mind I asked Eric
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 3:53 PM	Yes	He can
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 3:54 PM	Yes	Unless Eric said no?
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 3:54 PM	No	He hasn't responded
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 3:55 PM	No	Not a word to anyone? 
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 4:12 PM	Yes	I said something to Gabo about it while we were lifting today, but if you want no one else will know, you?
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 4:20 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 4:21 PM	Yes	Very little, and nothing, Gabo won't say anything, and I agree
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 4:22 PM	No	Very little as in.....?
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	If you're talking about me like I'm your latest conquest I'm going to kill you. 
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 4:42 PM	Yes	I told him that I was worried today might be awkward because you and I kissed last night, Gabo and I talk about these things occasionally 
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	Oh okay. Well it won't be awkward between you and me. It will be fine!
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 4:46 PM	No	Sorry I said I was going to kill you....
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 6:13 PM	No	Have you heard from Sam?
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 11:47 PM	Yes	What are we doing???
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 11:56 PM	No	I don't want you to do what you would do if you aren't with me. 
+13366719609	Feb 1, 2014, 11:59 PM	No	If you're hooking up with someone I would rather it be me than...
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 12:02 AM	Yes	I'd rather hook up with you than sit here awkwardly
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 12:05 AM	No	Does Sam wanna hook up with me?
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 9:15 AM	Yes	Starbucks on robin hood rd noon? We really should talk
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 10:00 AM	No	Is Sam still at your house? 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:31 AM	Yes	Yeah why?
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:32 AM	Yes	Would you rather come here?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 10:32 AM	No	I don't know how much I really have to say. I didn't realize Friday night was a mistake until you treated me how you treated me last night. 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:33 AM	Yes	I have a lot to say and would really appreciate if you heard me out
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:35 AM	Yes	I really want to salvage our friendship Hannah
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:35 AM	Yes	And I don't think that can happen unless we talk
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 10:34 AM	No	Okay. 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:35 AM	Yes	And please don't misinterpret the house thing, that's not me trying to hook up just asking if you wanted to have the conversation more privately
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 10:36 AM	No	Yeah I'm definitely not hooking up with you today. So  
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:38 AM	Yes	Yes I'm aware, does 1130 at Starbucks work for you?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 10:40 AM	No	Yeah it should be fine 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 1:52 PM	Yes	Can you leave first?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 1:52 PM	No	Why?
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 1:53 PM	Yes	Just because, please?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 1:52 PM	No	Why
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 1:54 PM	Yes	Because leaving right now needs to be your choice, not mine
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 1:55 PM	No	I have to go to cvs. Walk with me over there? 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 2:12 PM	No	I don't want to pit you and Sam against each other. Please
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 2:22 PM	No	Please don't tell him the things I told you. Please. 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 2:39 PM	Yes	I won't, but Hannah there aren't too many ways that we aren't put against each other and frankly none of them are great
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 2:39 PM	No	I know. And I'm so sorry. 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 4:43 PM	Yes	I've been thinking and I've changed my mind, can we talk?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 4:44 PM	No	I've been thinking too. Yeah
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 4:46 PM	Yes	Where do you want to meet?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 4:46 PM	No	Can we do it over the phone? 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 4:48 PM	Yes	I'd rather not 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 4:49 PM	No	I look like hell. I just got back from the Y 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 4:51 PM	Yes	Probably not, Starbucks at 530?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 4:52 PM	No	This is against my better judgement....
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 4:54 PM	Yes	Ignore that then, see you in a little
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	so against my better judgment 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 5:33 PM	No	You're late 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 6:13 PM	No	Wish me luck 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 6:15 PM	Yes	Good luck
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 6:40 PM	No	It could be going worse I guess...
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 6:44 PM	Yes	Wonderful...anything I can do yet?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 6:45 PM	No	I don't think so I'm sorry 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 6:47 PM	Yes	Look I really care about you, if your parents aren't okay with us than I respect that and will do my absolute best to make friends work, but if there is anything I can do to persuade them I will
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 6:49 PM	Yes	You deserve a good guy Hannah, and I understand why they might be hesitant, please get them to give me a chance, I will prove to them that it's not a mistake
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 6:50 PM	No	Thank you. I've gotten through my mom I think. My dad is still on the plane. But I'll call him when he lands. I'm going to do the best I can. They just worry about me and my past relationship issue. It's not that they think poorly of you. 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	They're making fun of me so that's a good sign 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 6:58 PM	Yes	:) that's good, let me know how it goes with your dad, and if there's anything that you need me to do
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	And you promise you're not just manipulating me to get what you want? I'm sticking my neck out for you.... 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 7:04 PM	Yes	I promise, Hannah I want to be with you
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 7:05 PM	No	If you're not telling me the truth Connor I swear to God
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	I will hate you and I will hate myself 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 7:13 PM	Yes	Hannah I care about you, and I really enjoy being around you, us is what I want, I promise
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 7:14 PM	No	Okay. I just called him. He said he would think about it and he and I will talk about it when he gets home on Wednesday. Is that okay with you? Can you wait? 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 7:17 PM	Yes	Yes, your pretty much the first girl I've ever been able to level with and I don't want to lose that, sorry for the time thing earlier I just needed to know what you wanted
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 7:19 PM	No	So now that you know what I want you can wait?
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 7:27 PM	Yes	Knowing that you want us to work makes waiting completely worth it
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	You're either a really smooth talker or you like me. But I'm going to go with that you like me. Let's just not tell anyone right now. Fair enough?
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 7:39 PM	Yes	:) I do like you, and yes, I think that's probably a good idea
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	Okay :) I'm glad we are on the same page. 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 7:57 PM	Yes	:) You watching this really disappointing game?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	Yes.... I really like manning so it's pretty upsetting. 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 8:19 PM	Yes	Yeah, I almost want to see Denver shutout at this point, what do you think of the red hot chili peppers outfits?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	Hahaha I sent that before I got your text
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 8:20 PM	No	I'm glad they brought Bruno Mars back...
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 8:21 PM	Yes	Haha nah, they can do whatever they want, and yeah I'm really impressed with him at the moment, he is really good live
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 8:25 PM	No	I guess that's true... Hahha \LFYeah he's really fun to watch 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	Oh no...
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 8:37 PM	Yes	This is pathetic, I didn't know FCD was playing in the Super Bowl
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	Hahaha that was good. Maybe if they yell Omaha some more it will help.... 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 8:55 PM	Yes	Oh my god
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	OH MY GOD
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	This is tragic 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 8:58 PM	Yes	More of a comedy
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 8:59 PM	Yes	I don't know how you play this poorly
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 9:00 PM	Yes	Peyton is ruining his fantastic season
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	I know. It's so so bad. I didn't think the game would be like this...
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	I think the broncos need Tim Riggins.... 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	Oh my god
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 9:04 PM	Yes	He could contribute his good looks to the bench...there are a lot of really emotional people in Vegas right now
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 9:05 PM	No	Yeah I think he could. Hahaha you didn't bet on anything did you? I heard you may have a gambling issue....
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	Do I say something to Sam? 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	And you do realize having a girlfriend  is somewhat of a responsibility right....?
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 9:14 PM	Yes	Haha no that's illegal, and that would probably be a good idea at some point, and no I thought it was just a title
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 9:14 PM	No	I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.... 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 9:21 PM	Yes	Sarcastic, I said I'm in Hannah, dates, spending time with you, taking care of you, listening to you, doing what it takes to make you happy, and wanting to do it all because I care about you, I'm in
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 9:24 PM	No	Okay. :) I believe you. Thank you 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	My parents have been on the phone with each other for quite some time 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:07 PM	Yes	Is that a good or bad sign? Or is it just not about us?
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	I think it's looking better than it was. You just have to promise me you're sure and you're not just trying to hook up. Im sorry I just have I make sure 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:31 PM	Yes	Hannah I promise, being with you and making you happy is what I want
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	Okay if you're sure. I think it's looking good. Or much better. You're probably going to have to sit down with my dad at some point...
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 10:50 PM	Yes	Good :) if you could tell him to leave the shotgun in a cabinet when that happens, I'd really appreciate it
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 10:56 PM	No	Haha yeah. I feel like that may be the best option for everyone involved. 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 11:11 PM	Yes	Haha definitely, I'm gonna go to sleep, goodnight Hannah 
+13366719609	Feb 2, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	Night! I'm glad we worked everything out. 
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 11:14 PM	Yes	Me too, night
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	I feel like such an ass 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:39 PM	Yes	We can't do anything about the fact that we handled Saturday poorly, we can only try to be better going forward, and Hannah though I wish the night had gone differently, I am extremely happy with where we are now. On the topic of moving forward, Corinne just texted me, how do we want to handle this?
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:43 PM	Yes	Honestly Hannah, I think the best thing would be to tell the truth
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	I don't think I can do that. It would be so offensive to him 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:45 PM	Yes	I know, but it can't be avoided, at some point he will find out that we are together, and the longer it takes for that to happen the worse it will be for him, if you'd like me to tell him I can
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:46 PM	No	I told him in the car I had no interest in you. 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:46 PM	No	What did Corinne say? 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:49 PM	Yes	I felt like it was awkward when we saw each other today and I don't want it to be. I promise I'm not mad at you or anything! 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:50 PM	Yes	Explain to him that you were upset, that though you felt that way on Saturday you realized that you still wanted to give me a chance
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:50 PM	Yes	Also what would you like me to say to Corinne?
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Connor I don't think I can do that. 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Just say something like okay. I am sorry it was so awkward on Saturday though. 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	And I don't understand why she thinks things are awkward between you two. It's not like you talked a lot to begin with... 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Sorry. That was mean 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	Or offer to play the same game with her that you did with Morgan last weekend if you want.... 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:59 PM	Yes	Hannah I know that it is going to take a while for you to believe this but I am committed, you do not need to be jealous, you do not need to worry about Corinne, or any other girl, I want to be with you
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:01 PM	Yes	That being said, I need you  to trust me, and if you could not make comments like that I would really appreciate it
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:02 PM	No	Okay. I'm sorry. I get sarcastic and mean 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:02 PM	No	And I guess our decisions Friday night are out...
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:05 PM	Yes	That was going to happen eventually, I'm sorry that it happened so soon
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:07 PM	Yes	But Hannah I don't think that we need to be a secret
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:07 PM	No	We really screwed up on Saturday 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:08 PM	Yes	Because we wanted to keep secrets
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:07 PM	No	I don't know Connor 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:08 PM	Yes	Hannah it solves all of our problems
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:09 PM	No	But Sam 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:12 PM	Yes	Hannah disappointing him is unavoidable, the only reason to keep him in the dark would be to keep him a viable option for you, and I do not believe and very seriously hope that that is not a consideration
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:14 PM	No	No I'm not keeping him as an option. He told me it's the definition of nice guys finish last and I told him it wasn't like that. 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	And there's nothing to tell yet. I need to still speak to my dad. And you probably do too 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:26 PM	Yes	Hannah you yourself said earlier today that the exclusivity starts now, whether or not we are officially a couple there is certainly something to say, and getting strung along Hannah, that is the definition of nice guys finish last
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:29 PM	No	I'm not stringing you along. I want to be with you and you know that. 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:32 PM	Yes	Not me, you are stringing sam along
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:32 PM	No	By the way. I got a 70 on my math test today. I think I may need some help at some point if you're willing...
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	I'm not stringing him along I told him I'm not going next week 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:34 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:36 PM	Yes	I'm happy to help, and what did you say to him before that?
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:36 PM	No	
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	And then he told me you told Gabo and Gabo is telling everyone. But I'm not supposed to tell you that...
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:44 PM	Yes	I apologize, Gabo is being louder than I expected, and I thought I told you I told Gabo?
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	No you did! I'm not mad 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:45 PM	No	But is he telling a lot of people? 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:46 PM	Yes	No, but to be honest Hannah part of the reason I don't want to keep this secret is because i am terrible at secrets
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:47 PM	No	I understand. But you can't be broadcasting everything we do across the school. I will be really upset if that happens 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:51 PM	Yes	I won't do that, but I'm really bad at lying when people ask
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	I understand that. But just please don't be sharing all of our business to the whole school 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 10:59 PM	Yes	I won't, but Hannah I am protective, and I would like people, particularly sam to know that we are together
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	Are you protective just because I told you I wanted that from someone? Or do you genuinely feel like that?
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:08 PM	Yes	I want you Hannah, and I want people to know that you are mine, and I want that because you want it and because I genuinely feel that way
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 11:13 PM	No	Okay. After we talk to my dad you can tell whoever you want. Is that fair?
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 11:17 PM	No	And I'm sorry you may have to jump through hoops with him. He's just extremely protective now and it doesn't have to do with you 
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 11:17 PM	No	What did Corinne say?
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:28 PM	Yes	That's fair, I will do my best to wait until then, and I'm happy to jump through hoops, and I stopped responding, I don't know what to say, also I don't think letting Sam find out from other people fixes that problem
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 11:30 PM	No	Yeah please do your best. Did she seem interested...? We can tell him first whenever we start telling people? 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:38 PM	Yes	I don't know, I stopped responding because I can't say what I want to say to her, and I'm not sure that makes it better, I still think that sooner is the way to go
+13366719609	Feb 3, 2014, 11:42 PM	No	Why don't you just tell her you like me? 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:53 PM	Yes	Because at this point it just makes sense to pretend I fell asleep, and because I didn't know you were okay with me doing that
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:54 PM	Yes	Also I know this is a touchy subject, but why can't you say that to Sam?
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 12:00 AM	No	Please don't think it's because I'm interested in him. It's just that he pretty much emotionally unloaded on me on Saturday night and made me feel guilty for things that he shouldn't have and I felt bad. And I insisted I didn't like you because it was an awkward situation and I was mad at you. And he told me if I went running back to you on Sunday he would be extremely upset and he explained he didn't take rejection well at all 
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 12:00 AM	No	And I feel like the only responsibility I had to him was calling off the date 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 12:22 AM	Yes	I trust you Hannah, and if you say that you are committed to me I will believe it, the main reason that I want you to tell Sam is because telling Sam that we are together is what is best for him, the longer he feels like we kept this from him the more upset he is going to be, ima go to sleep, good night and sweet dreams Hannah 
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 1:36 PM	No	I think Corinne is telling Yasmin...like now. Corinne looked like she was going to cry. They just left. 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 1:41 PM	Yes	That's unfortunate...maybe you could talk to her? Probably be awkward as hell though
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	Dammit. She didn't tell me she liked you until it was too late. 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 1:45 PM	Yes	Would that really have made a difference?
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 1:46 PM	No	No....but I feel like a better person if I say that...
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 1:50 PM	Yes	I suppose that's fair
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 1:50 PM	No	I'm really just a shitty person. 
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 1:50 PM	No	She came back 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 1:52 PM	Yes	Not really, and?
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 1:52 PM	No	I think  she was crying but I don't know. Do I say something? 
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 1:52 PM	No	I can't feel bad. I had no idea and she told me there were no feelings for you. So I can't feel bad right? 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 1:55 PM	Yes	Your call, and no you shouldn't feel bad, it's not your fault that I want you
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 1:56 PM	No	Yeah but in her eyes I'm sure it's my fault. 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 2:15 PM	Yes	Possibly
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 6:25 PM	No	 I talked to my dad 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 6:27 PM	Yes	How'd it go?
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 6:29 PM	No	I think we are good to go:) he wants to meet you but no inquisition or anything 
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	And Corinne was upset about something totally different 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 6:37 PM	Yes	That is all really good news :) I almost just completely forgot my duke interview
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 6:38 PM	Yes	Also, when does he want to meet?
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	Annnnd please don't tell anyone about what I said about Sam. He texted me again saying not to tell anyone. 
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	It's great:) oh no. Are you going now? Just when you're over sometime? 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 6:45 PM	Yes	I won't, and it's at 830 but I was headed to swim practice where I would never have remembered
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 6:48 PM	Yes	And that works, unless you think I should come over on my way to the interview? I'd be dressed up which makes me look matureish maybe?
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 6:50 PM	No	No you don't have to do that:) thank you very much for offering though. It won't be a huge deal 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 6:58 PM	Yes	Okay, I'm happy to do that however you think best, I really want him to like me
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	Okay :) I really appreciate that 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 7:26 PM	Yes	:)
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 7:26 PM	Yes	What was Corinne upset about?
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	her brother may not be doing well :/ 
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	Good luck in your interview!!
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 8:15 PM	Yes	That's not good :/ and thanks!
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 8:20 PM	No	Yeah I told her to talk to her parents so she'll hopefully do that. You'll do great I'm sure. 
+13366719609	Feb 4, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	I think I'm about to fall asleep. I hope your interview went well!! I'll see you tomorrow. Night! 
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 10:02 PM	Yes	Night Hannah 
+17344782101	Feb 5, 2014, 1:26 PM	Yes	I am having to lie very hard to Sam right now
+13366719609	Feb 5, 2014, 1:27 PM	No	What did you say?
+17344782101	Feb 5, 2014, 1:29 PM	Yes	That we talked, are friends and that you aren't mad at me anymore, he asked why you dropped your plans with him and I told him it's because you were mad Friday and wanted time to think
+17344782101	Feb 5, 2014, 1:30 PM	Yes	Where are you?
+13366719609	Feb 5, 2014, 1:30 PM	No	Library. Want me to come to you? I'm with Corinne 
+17344782101	Feb 5, 2014, 1:32 PM	Yes	No it's fine, I'm leaving right after school, and want to see you before I go though
+13366719609	Feb 5, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	I would say just tell everyone but you pretty much told everyone at Jos that you had liked Madison for all of high school. And that was like a week ago. 
+17344782101	Feb 5, 2014, 1:40 PM	Yes	Hannah I doubt that anyone remembers that, and I was drunk 
+13366719609	Feb 5, 2014, 1:46 PM	No	But you were telling the truth. I'm not mad. Just the way it is 
+17344782101	Feb 5, 2014, 1:49 PM	Yes	But clearly it bothers you
+17344782101	Feb 5, 2014, 1:56 PM	Yes	And I don't want it to, because it doesn't need to
+13366719609	Feb 5, 2014, 1:59 PM	No	If course it does
+17344782101	Feb 5, 2014, 2:21 PM	Yes	Hannah I like you, not her
+13366719609	Feb 6, 2014, 3:58 PM	No	I think I'm showing weakness by texting you....but 
+17344782101	Feb 6, 2014, 4:00 PM	Yes	Haha no, I've been wanting to text you, very busy though so I may not be super quick to respond
+13366719609	Feb 6, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	Haha are you sure you've wanted to text? No you're fine. I'm sitting at the rehab place for physical therapy and I'm waiting patiently but I'm not very patient 
+13366719609	Feb 6, 2014, 4:02 PM	No	And my mom met me in the parking lot all excited about a Davidson letter but it was just them telling me that I didn't make it to the next round for the Belk 
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 12:14 AM	Yes	I'm sorry Hannah, how'd the rehab go? And I apologize for not texting back, this is the first time things have slowed down all day
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 12:15 AM	Yes	Your probably asleep, so good night, I will do my best to text you tomorrow, it should be a lot less hectic
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 7:18 AM	No	It was okay! No you're fine! I know you're really really busy. Please don't worry about it. I'm sorry if I made you feel guilty
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 8:38 PM	Yes	It's okay, I should really be better about texting, how'd your day go?
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	 No it's completely fine. I know you're really busy! It was okay!! I don't think I did well on my math quiz but we pretty much just had study halls all day. And then Josie told me that a lot of people know about Friday. I don't care at all but I thought I would tell you. How's your day?
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 11:15 PM	Yes	Nice, and I'm sure you killed your quiz, yeah Gabo told me Sam was telling a bunch of people, it was exhausting, and the party was a little bit of a flop
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:18 PM	No	Let's hope. Oh that's solid. Have you talked to sam? Yeah it sounds like y'all are really busy according to jake. And I'm sure it was fine! Apparently there was face paint and you were dancing. That's really all people need 
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 11:26 PM	Yes	Can I do that? I'd still like to, and crazy busy, and yeah I suppose, we weren't allowed to jump though and as you're aware jumping up and down is about the extent of my dancing ability
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 11:28 PM	Yes	I need to know right now, because I'm about to tell him 
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:30 PM	No	Yeah it's fine I guess. Please just be nice 
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	I think you're going to tell him one way or another...
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 11:42 PM	Yes	He's not taking it we'll
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:41 PM	No	What did you say
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:47 PM	No	Are you still  talking to hkn?
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:47 PM	No	Him 
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 11:51 PM	Yes	He asked me why I wouldn't do anything with this girl at conference
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:51 PM	No	And...?
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 11:52 PM	Yes	I told him I didn't want to because I like you and am talking to you
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 11:53 PM	Yes	He was mad that we didn't tell him right away
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:53 PM	No	Hey it's good news you didn't hook up with anyone! Is that all that happened? 
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:53 PM	No	And I'm kidding 
+13366719609	Feb 7, 2014, 11:57 PM	No	Was he really upset? 
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 12:03 AM	Yes	He is pretty upset, and Hannah you really are what I want right now, I do not want to hook up with other girls
+13366719609	Feb 8, 2014, 12:05 AM	No	Like calling me names upset...? \LFThank you. I know it's what you want now I just don't want you to change your mind :) I miss you
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 12:15 AM	Yes	No, just disappointed, he shed a tear, and I'm not going to change my mind :) I miss you too
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 12:16 AM	Yes	Do you still think you'll be able to do something Sunday?
+13366719609	Feb 8, 2014, 12:15 AM	No	Please tell me you're being sarcastic. I can't tell. 
+13366719609	Feb 8, 2014, 12:15 AM	No	Yeah if I can get off the couch...
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 12:30 AM	Yes	I'm not, and haha I'm happy to come to your couch, really though you better be able to because I miss you quite a bit
+13366719609	Feb 8, 2014, 12:32 AM	No	You're not being sarcastic?? He cried? Haha that sounds good.  Wow. Quite a lot? That's a good amount 
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 12:37 AM	Yes	I wouldn't call it crying, it was one tear, and yes it's a large amount, you should have come to yag
+13366719609	Feb 8, 2014, 12:41 AM	No	Oh my gosh I feel terrible if he cried. Oh my god. \LFYeah that probably wouldn't have been the BEST idea. But tempting 
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 12:50 AM	Yes	He will get over it, he is still upset with you though, and yes it would have, then you'd be here with me, making it the best
+13366719609	Feb 8, 2014, 12:54 AM	No	I'm such a bad person... Yeah tempting...tempting...I'm trying to not get kicked out before graduation 
+13366719609	Feb 8, 2014, 12:56 AM	No	Do you have roommates?
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 1:11 AM	Yes	You are really a good person, and we could be sneaky, and yes I do, Josiah, Devon, and Adam
+13366719609	Feb 8, 2014, 1:13 AM	No	That's a lot of people to be sneaky around...since you're so important there I thought you'd have your own room... 
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 1:26 AM	Yes	Haha I would make them leave, and yeah I wish, unfortunately they won't stroke my ego that much, I've got to go sleep, goodnight and sweet dreams Hannah  
+13366719609	Feb 8, 2014, 1:31 AM	No	That's classy...haha night! Have a good day tomorrow!! 
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 8:24 AM	Yes	Hannah, thanks for being so understanding about my not texting you much this weekend, I'm a terrible multi tasker and I really appreciate that you've let me be here in the moment, you are awesome. Unfortunately, I am starting to get a little sick so if you don't want to hang out later I understand, that being said I still want to see you today even if I have to wear a mask and sit across the room, I really miss you
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:10 AM	No	Of course :) no problem. No I want to see you! But how sick is sick...?
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 10:36 AM	Yes	Just a cold, now that I've taken DayQuil it's not really noticeable, also don't tell him but your brother won his election
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	Oh okay. As long as you're not throwing up I don't really care. Really? I'm so happy for him! When will you be home?
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 10:53 AM	Yes	Not sure, probably around 2ish, but we might have band practice for a little bit
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:53 AM	No	Okay. And are you going to swim practice? 
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 11:06 AM	Yes	Haha no, I'm way to sick for that
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 11:09 AM	No	Okay. I'm so sorry you're sick. How are things there?
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 12:21 PM	Yes	I was kidding I just don't want to go, they went really well, everyone who was suppose to got elected, everyone is crying though
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 12:23 PM	No	Okay good. Crying? Yeah jake just texted saying he didn't win.
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 12:35 PM	Yes	Girls are emotional Hannah, and I think first and second get a position in the thing he was running for, he may have gotten second
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 12:41 PM	No	I can hear you patronizing from here:). Yeah I think he's bummed because he doesn't get to go to dc though 
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 2:33 PM	Yes	Haha no, and actually he can and definitely should still apply to cona, he's got a pretty good shot
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 2:51 PM	No	Oh good! He'll be glad to know that
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 3:34 PM	Yes	I should be home around 4:30 do you want to come over around 5:15 and have dinner and watch a movie or something?
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 3:37 PM	No	Yeah sure!
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 3:42 PM	Yes	:)
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 3:41 PM	No	Hopefully I won't offend your parents too much? 
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 3:50 PM	Yes	They will like you
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 3:51 PM	No	
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 5:06 PM	No	I'm getting ready to leave. Is that okay?
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 5:08 PM	Yes	Yeah, hey my dad is on a little bit of a tirade and insists I go to dinner with him at my cousins, I want you to come, but if you aren't comfortable with that we can meet up after
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	Whatever is best for you! If your dads upset we can definitely just meet up after. I'm agreeable. I can just do some homework or something 
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 5:12 PM	Yes	I want to see you as soon as possible, your house is actually on the way so I can just pick you up 
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 5:13 PM	No	Whatever is best for you!
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 5:21 PM	No	If you want to eat with them you can! I'm fine with anything:)
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 5:21 PM	No	Or we can hang out here after I really don't care

+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 10:20 PM	Yes	Hey I was thinking about being competitive, elections, and your brother
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	Hey yeah? 
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 10:21 PM	Yes	And remembered that I lost the secretary race, maybe you could use that example to illustrate that the best candidate doesn't always win?
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	It was treasurer butt head 
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:27 PM	No	Daniels pissing me off 
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 10:30 PM	Yes	How so?
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	And I feel bad I didn't say hi to your parents
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	Because he's concerned or some shit 
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 10:38 PM	Yes	You shouldn't, and concerned as in doesn't think you should be with me?
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	No I do. That's not respectful of me. Na as in I move on too fast. But it's fine
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	Will your mom be at the meet tomorrow? I feel really bad
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 10:54 PM	Yes	It is really fine, and possibly, next time we'll be sure to talk to them, and Daniel can be very persuasive
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	Ugh but they probably think I didn't want to talk to them  or was being rude \LFYeah but so can you..
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 11:00 PM	Yes	Hannah they think neither of those things, and yes, but I don't like the idea of someone trying to persuade you not to be with me, I really like you and really want us to work
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 11:02 PM	No	You don't have to worry about it. And don't say anything to him 
+13366719609	Feb 9, 2014, 11:02 PM	No	Please

+13366719609	Feb 10, 2014, 10:10 AM	No	If you don't get here soon I'm coming over and taking a nap with you. 
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 10:27 AM	Yes	In that case I really should have stayed home
+13366719609	Feb 10, 2014, 10:45 AM	No	Definitely 
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 1:37 PM	Yes	Are you coming on the bus?
+13366719609	Feb 10, 2014, 1:37 PM	No	Yeah you?
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 1:43 PM	Yes	Didn't want to sit next to me?
+13366719609	Feb 10, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	I thought you'd sit with Megan! I'm sorry :)

+13366719609	Feb 10, 2014, 10:49 PM	No	The softball season will be hellacious. So just prepare yourself for a lot of long conversations about me complaining 
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 11:19 PM	Yes	Hellacious is a funny word, and I'm prepared, just prepare yourself for lots of distraction and conversation changes
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 11:22 PM	Yes	And really, if you need to complain or are angry and need someone to listen I'm here for you
+13366719609	Feb 10, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	It's an accurate word. I can prepare myself for distractions. And thanks I appreciate it :) 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 8:12 PM	Yes	How was physical therapy? Lots of knee popping?
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	Someone's not at practice...yeah lots of popping. But it was okay! Thanks for asking. The college guy didn't beat you up too badly? 
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	We don't have school tomorrow! That means I don't have to read macro tonight!! 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 8:25 PM	Yes	No he was twenty pounds light and not good, and yeah I skipped to read the fifty pages of macro
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 8:26 PM	Yes	And thank god, I was not making much headway
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 8:29 PM	No	That's good! I was worried. Yeah it's all really boring 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 8:41 PM	Yes	Haha, and yeah, so what are we going to do with our snow day tomorrow?
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	Yeah! What do you want to do? The only thing is I'm supposed to go to rehab at 1115. will they still be open you think?
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	Wanna get snowed in together?? 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 9:02 PM	Yes	I would really like that, a lot, not sure about the rehab, but I have band practice in the morning at 9, so we'd have to meet up after that
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:04 PM	No	Okay!  Are we thinking of actually doing something? Or day on the couch? 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	Your call, I think the roads will actually be pretty bad, so I'm not sure driving would be the best idea
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	Day on the couch then?
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:11 PM	No	Unless you want to be social!
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	I want to be with you, I am perfectly content either way
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:14 PM	No	I mean I haven't been invited to anything I don't know if people are doing anything
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 9:18 PM	Yes	We can find out, or we can hang out on the couch, do you have a preference?
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	I do but whatever you want :) 
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	I'll be okay with anything I promise. 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 9:27 PM	Yes	I want to do what you want :) I think there is a breakfast tomorrow, but the time isn't set and I can't go if it conflicts with band practice, I just pitched a big fit about jay skipping
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	You pitching a fit? No. Never.... 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 9:37 PM	Yes	We had a scheduled practice and he decided to go to vandy, and no I never pitch fits
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	That's frustrating. I'm sorry 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 9:52 PM	Yes	It's okay, breakfast tomorrow is too early :/ you still haven't told me your preference by the way
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	Hmmm what do you think my preference is?
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 9:57 PM	Yes	Hannah that question is a trap, I've got a better one, what is your preference?
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	Dammit. I'm really fine with anything :) and I know you don't want to be antisocial but I'm fine not spending tomorrow with other people  
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 10:19 PM	No	I would rather just hang out tomorrow 
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 10:19 PM	No	Better? Less indecisive? 
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 10:29 PM	No	My power just went out and I HAVE to watch Shaun white. 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 10:35 PM	Yes	Haha I take a few extra minutes to respond and I get a decision, and I'm sorry, you could come watch it with me at Robbie's, and I'm really glad that you want to just hang out, you are the only one I want to spend tomorrow with :)
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	Yeah I guess you figured out that trick pretty quickly. No it's okay it's back on. And I'm in my pajamas. Robbie wouldn't appreciate that haha. Who's there? Good :) 
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 10:49 PM	No	Oh my gosh. 
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	I think I'm going to cry 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 10:57 PM	Yes	Haha I think he would, and Louie and Brian, Eric was supposed to come, why are you going to cry?
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:00 PM	No	My flannel pants are really attractive. He lost...
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:06 PM	Yes	I bet, and that is sad, he had a long run, Brian is being a dick
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:09 PM	No	Yeah it's unfortunate. What's he doing? 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:17 PM	Yes	Insulting you, I'm winning
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:18 PM	No	What's he saying...? 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:20 PM	Yes	He's making things up to piss me off, I think he wants me to hit him
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	It can't be that bad...
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	I haven't done anything to him!
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:22 PM	No	What did he say? 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:22 PM	Yes	I know, like I said, making things up to aggravate me, he stopped
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:24 PM	Yes	And he just said he didn't mean any of it and likes you as a person, I think he may have been drinking 
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	He probably said that because you threatened to hit him..
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:26 PM	Yes	No, he's the friend with a problem I was telling you about a few weeks ago
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:26 PM	No	Oh I'm sorry I didn't realize that. Is he ok? 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:30 PM	Yes	Yeah, but he is not tolerable when he's been drinking, I think he's trying to stop though
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:30 PM	No	Yeah that may be a good idea 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:38 PM	Yes	He really needs to, you still watching the Olympics?
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:40 PM	No	That's not good. Yeah the news is on now. I should get up and go to bed because I think I'm about to fall asleep. What're y'all doing 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:45 PM	Yes	Playing poker, yeah the news will do that to you
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:45 PM	No	Don't get drunk and lose all your money please. Yeah I turned on friends 
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:52 PM	Yes	I told you earlier I was winning Hannah, and I don't drink and gamble, not until the dr, and that's a great show
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:55 PM	No	No you missed that part :) hey that's a good policy 
+13366719609	Feb 11, 2014, 11:55 PM	No	Did you know Jennifer Anniston turned 45 today??
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:03 AM	Yes	That is crazy, she doesn't look a day past twenty
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:02 AM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:14 AM	Yes	Kidding, she looks old and unattractive
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:14 AM	Yes	Better?
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:16 AM	No	Hey your girlfriend is sick. But you were too busy baking a cake for Jen to know... 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:22 AM	Yes	Are you really sick? I feel terrible if you are
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:23 AM	Yes	The cake turned out fantastic though
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:24 AM	No	Woah I thought I got a moment of concern out of you! But tell her I say hi when you deliver the cake 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:28 AM	Yes	Will do, but really, are you feeling all right?
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:28 AM	No	Want me to just talk to you whenever we go back to school? I know y'all will be super busy this weekend 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:31 AM	Yes	No, that doesn't work cause you and I are spending all day together tomorrow
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:30 AM	No	Not if I lock myself in my bedroom 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:35 AM	Yes	No don't do that
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:34 AM	No	We'll see...
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:42 AM	Yes	Okay, you can only do that if I'm in there with you though
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:45 AM	No	I guess that's fair 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:45 AM	No	But we should invite the whole gang too 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:47 AM	Yes	Nah, tomorrow is antisocial day, just us
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:49 AM	No	Oh yeah. I did say that. 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:49 AM	No	I'm regretting that word choice 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:53 AM	Yes	I'm not
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:55 AM	No	Then we are napping alllllll day
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:58 AM	Yes	That sounds fantastic
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:59 AM	No	Does it?
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 1:02 AM	Yes	Yes :)
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:02 AM	No	I'm impressed 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:02 AM	No	Are you home yet? 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 1:07 AM	Yes	No, Louie and I are going heads up so it will probably be a while
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:06 AM	No	 Okay. I think I'm going to bed. Be careful going home? 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 1:08 AM	Yes	I will, good night and sweet dreams Hannah :)
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:09 AM	No	Night :) see you tomorrow 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:03 AM	No	If I have one more dream that involves you cheating on me I quit 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 10:04 AM	Yes	I hope you don't mean quit me
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:05 AM	No	Haha no. 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 10:13 AM	Yes	By the way I told you to have good dreams
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:17 AM	No	Yeah I know. But I woke up crying so I don't think it worked...
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 10:18 AM	Yes	Hannah :(
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:19 AM	No	Haha I'm fine 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:19 AM	No	I'm kidding mostly 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 10:27 AM	Yes	Mostly meaning?
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:28 AM	No	Eh..... :)
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:30 AM	No	Aren't you supposed to be practicing...?
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 10:35 AM	Yes	I am practicing, we're being fairly productive to actually
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:36 AM	No	Oh really? That's surprising! You didn't say anything to Daniel did you? He apologized yesterday 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 11:00 AM	Yes	Really, and no I didn't 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 11:01 AM	No	Okay thank you 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 11:10 AM	No	Brad needs to come call my name so we can get this over with. 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 11:13 AM	Yes	Isn't your appointment not until 1115?
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:18 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:24 PM	Yes	I'm sorry :( do you want me to pick you up and take you to my house or do you want to just drive there?
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:25 PM	No	Would you mind picking me up? I think I would have to take my moms car and I don't really wanna do that. Would you mind? You're more than welcome to hang out at my house but I know you haven't seen your family a lot lately 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:32 PM	Yes	I can pick you up, I'd rather hang out at my house, but if you'd prefer to be at yours than we can do that, also I'm going to Waffle House with the band and probably won't be there until 145ish, is that okay?
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:34 PM	No	Okay. If you don't mind. Yours is fine! They just hooked me up to that electric thing and I have to go home and shower. I should be ready by then but I'll let you know?
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 12:41 PM	Yes	Sounds good, what electric thing?
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:44 PM	No	It sends impulses or something? Like they stick it to you. They have one at school 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 12:44 PM	No	I really have no clue what it is but it feels really good 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:11 PM	No	Okay I just got home and I'll shower as fast as I can
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 1:12 PM	Yes	Okay, I'm still not back from Waffle House so it might be a little bit
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:22 PM	No	Okay take your time please...
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 1:30 PM	Yes	Okay, trying to get there before the roads go to shit though
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	Okay have you left?
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 1:34 PM	Yes	Still not home yet, I could pick you up with the band 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:36 PM	No	Whatever's best for you. Just give me like a ten minute heads up 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:49 PM	No	My dad just called to tell me he'll be picking me up at some point tonight...
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 1:50 PM	Yes	Okay, on my way, im happy to take you back later if he wants
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 1:52 PM	No	I'll tell him thank you 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 2:18 PM	Yes	I'm here
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 5:35 PM	Yes	I made it
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 5:34 PM	No	Good :) 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 5:49 PM	Yes	There were a lot of people sledding on the roads in your neighborhood
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 5:50 PM	No	Darn. I'm missing out. Maybe I'll go tomorrow 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 6:47 PM	Yes	I haven't been sledding in forever
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	I know. Me too. I just fell asleep so hard 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 9:17 PM	Yes	What does falling asleep hard mean exactly?
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	Crashed/passed out?\LF
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 9:56 PM	No	Did I annoy you today...? 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 10:02 PM	Yes	No, sorry I've been so slow to respond, I'm back at Robbie's 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:04 PM	No	No you're totally fine. I just want to make sure I didn't drive you insane. Would you tell me?
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 10:38 PM	Yes	I would, and I really enjoyed today, I spend way too much time doing stuff, it's nice to just lay down and relax, especially with you 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	Okay good. 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 10:55 PM	Yes	You do anything exciting after I left?
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	Yeah. A bunch of people came over. How about you? 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 11:05 PM	Yes	Can't tell if you are being sarcastic, and no, not really
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 11:06 PM	No	Oh I'm not. \LFHow's Robbie's?
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 11:15 PM	Yes	It's alright, we're watching jackass and I'm losing money
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	Oh that sounds like fun! Has Brian said anything else offensive?
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 11:23 PM	Yes	Ehh, and no, it's just the greenbrier kids tonight
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	Ohh are Alex and John there? 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 11:30 PM	Yes	They are, jackass is very frustrating 
+13366719609	Feb 12, 2014, 11:35 PM	No	Yeahhhh I think I've seen it once 
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 11:56 PM	Yes	That is more than enough times
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 12:00 AM	No	Yeah it's kind of idiotic 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 12:08 AM	Yes	And disgusting, so who all came to your house? 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 12:09 AM	No	Uh The neighbors to borrow marshmallows 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 12:09 AM	No	I was being sarcastic :)
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 12:45 AM	Yes	Haha figured, I'm really bad at reading sarcasm in texts, you have any plans for tomorrow?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 12:47 AM	No	Yeah it's hard sometimes. Absolutely nothing. You?
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 12:52 AM	Yes	Impossible really, and nothing yet
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 12:54 AM	No	Yet? That sounds foreboding 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 1:02 AM	Yes	It's not suppose to, more of an invitation/question actually 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 1:03 AM	No	Oh subtle invitation? Not fulling inviting but hinting at it? 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 1:21 AM	Yes	I think something along those lines, but I'm sleepy so I'm not sure I'm making sense
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 1:24 AM	No	Are you asking me to do something tomorrow? 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 1:24 AM	No	Maybe you should go to bed..
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 1:28 AM	No	Tim isn't going to do well in jail  
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 1:43 AM	Yes	Possibly, I'm not sure if I can drive that far yet, and I'm actually gonna take that bed advice, and no he's too pretty, good night Hannah, please have dreams about me being a faithful and loyal boyfriend
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 9:25 AM	No	I'm sorry I fell asleep. But your request worked!
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 10:56 AM	Yes	:) hey I've got some unfortunate news, my parents aren't letting me leave today, and as of now the wrestling tournament has been pushed back to start at one o'clock tomorrow, meaning it won't end until passed ten o'clock :(
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 11:02 AM	No	It's really okay! It's not a big deal :) I know you'd rather roll aroun with hot sweaty guys anyway. 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 11:23 AM	Yes	Of course, well if that changes I will let you know and we will do something Friday, if not well have to do Saturday, does that work for you? At least this way you can go get drunk with your single friends
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 11:24 AM	No	Yeah that's perfectly fine :) na I doubt they will actually do anything 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 11:25 AM	No	And I would much rather be with you anyway 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 12:34 PM	Yes	Good :) to be honest I'd rather be with you than a bunch of sweaty guys as well, you been sledding yet?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 12:50 PM	No	Yeah jake and I are with a guy in our neighborhood. Jake is devastated you aren't here...
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 1:11 PM	Yes	Haha again I can't read sarcasm in texts, and the guy better be jakes age or ugly
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 1:14 PM	No	No seriously he keeps asking where you are. \LFAnd I think he's a junior but no worries 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 1:23 PM	Yes	I really do wish I could be there, and that's good, I'm assuming that means he doesn't hate me?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 1:26 PM	No	Hey mr. Have you seen the latest pictures I was tagged in on facebook? No worries about the neighbor :) \LFYeah! I think he likes you:)
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 2:41 PM	No	You must be on your way over   I should have told you that you didn't have to walk all the way over here! 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 3:24 PM	Yes	Haha alright, and good :) and I don't think I could physically make it that far Hannah, I went sledding with my brother and left my phone at my house
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 3:33 PM	No	Connor you're competing in two state events. You should be able to physically make it that far. Did y'all have fun?
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 4:00 PM	Yes	Yeah you would think that, and yeah, we probably ended up walking far enough to get to your house actually, the hill was pretty far away
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 4:11 PM	No	I would sass you but I won't... I'm sure y'all had fun! Someone ruined our snowman so we are a little upset 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 4:11 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 6:11 PM	Yes	Damn, that things is huge, and sorry I just passed out, the sledding effort proved to be way to much, thank you for not sassing me
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	No you're fine! I'm glad you were able to hang tough with the sixth grader though. 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 6:56 PM	Yes	Ouch, that was not particularly nice, and actually he didn't even need a nap, are you excited for black history month?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	It was pretty funny though... Oh yeah! How'd you know? 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 7:23 PM	Yes	It's just a very important month to me, also there was a big anti-republican rally during yag, and I just saw something about it on tv
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	I can't hear the tone of your voice so I'm struggling. 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 7:46 PM	Yes	Yeah it's not easy is it? And thick sarcasm if that helps, my dad does not have great music tastes and he keeps trying to suggest songs for my band to play and it's awkward
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	Oh okay good because it was going to be uncomfortable if you weren't being sarcastic. Haha what's he suggesting?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 8:38 PM	No	This math thing is becoming an issue 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 8:40 PM	Yes	Probably not anything you would recognize, it was a lot of semi popular older songs that just really weren't good, and way too heavy, any thing I can help you with from here?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	Haha he was trying! \LFI don't think so. I need to try to figure it out but I'm struggling...thank you though :)
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 8:55 PM	Yes	Haha I know, and okay, I'm here to help if you need me, you just reminded me that I really need to start being productive
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 8:59 PM	No	Thanks I appreciate it. Oh I'm sorry...I haven't done really anything if it makes you feel better 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 8:59 PM	No	So do I need to come to see you win tomorrow? 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 9:09 PM	Yes	Slightly, and haha, I'm probably going to get my ass handed to me, besides it's probably best you stay off the roads, I really appreciate that you've thought about it though :)
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 9:13 PM	No	No you're going to do really well! They'll be super freaked out by your shaved body and so you'll have the factor of surprise. You know I don't mind coming? That I want to come right? 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	I shouldn't have used the word need I'm\LFSorry 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 9:24 PM	Yes	Haha Hannah, I'm not going to do well, and don't worry, I'm not so particular about word choice remember? 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 9:26 PM	No	Oh yeah I forgot about that a little bit... :) but would you like me to come? 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 9:43 PM	Yes	Haha funny, and no, I don't want you driving all the way to Wesleyan, especially just to see me roll around with dudes, I really appreciate the offer though :)
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	Total side note. Saying someone's been around the block, is that inappropriate? Or just that they've gone around? 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	You promise you would tell me?
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 9:45 PM	Yes	Promise I would tell you what? And it's not really a nice comment but I suppose it's appropriate if true, are you saying that about me?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	If you wanted me to come. No no. It came up in my group message after Samantha called me a hoe. So I was just wondering.
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 9:49 PM	No	But when my grandmother asked about you I told her you were an angry and driven person that had been around the block. 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 9:57 PM	Yes	Oh, and perfect, that is exactly how I want your family to view me, quick question, is this the Sam jake is into?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 10:01 PM	No	You would tell me honestly if you wanted me to come right? Yeah I just wanted to give them the best mental image possible. Yeah but he doesn't want to mess up their friendship I guess I don't know 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 10:13 PM	Yes	Hannah I've considered and though of course I would like to have you there to support me, and really appreciate your willingness to do so, it's best if you don't come, and the friendship won't be the same for him after Hannah, you should probably tell him that, not saying it's impossible for people to be friends after dating but it's always different
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 10:19 PM	No	Okay. Yeah I know. And he knows that. He's pretty wise for a 14 year old. I mean I ask him for advice and he usually does a pretty good job. :) 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 10:26 PM	Yes	That's good, you ever ask him for advice about me?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 10:29 PM	No	:) 
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 10:30 PM	No	He's a really good judge of character so you don't need to be worried. 
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 10:44 PM	Yes	Haha I don't really like non answers
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 10:47 PM	No	I just asked him if he liked you
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 11:03 PM	Yes	I really hope that he does, anyway, how's the math coming?
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 11:09 PM	No	No he really does! I think you impressed him at yag. I literally did nothing...
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 11:46 PM	Yes	That makes me feel a little better about my inability to be productive, and I figured as much about the yah thing, but I want him to like me, not just be impressed
+17344782101	Feb 13, 2014, 11:46 PM	Yes	Yag*
+13366719609	Feb 13, 2014, 11:51 PM	No	I really think he does! Just make sure you treat him as an equal, which you do, and it will go a long way with him and my parents 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 12:02 AM	Yes	I will, thanks for the advice. netflix is going to ruin my life
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 12:07 AM	No	Oh yeah I totally agree. It's a problem for me 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 12:38 AM	Yes	Half the time I don't even like what I'm watching, it's all just so accessible
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 1:04 AM	Yes	Happy valentines day Hannah 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 9:02 AM	No	Happy valentines day!!!
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 12:15 PM	No	I'm sorry I fell asleep last night 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 12:27 PM	No	Good luck today!! 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 2:23 PM	Yes	That's fine, and thanks! Again I'm sorry I'm not with you today, I really want to be
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 2:30 PM	No	I mean I'm a little depressed :) but it means a lot that you want to be with me!
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 2:50 PM	Yes	I feel awful, and of course the late start today means everything is pushed back tomorrow as well :(
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 2:51 PM	Yes	I will leave as soon as I am eliminated, but in the unlikely event that I go to the finals I might not get back until pretty late
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 2:52 PM	No	Don't feel awful! I want you to do well :) you all are wrestling tomorrow too?
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 2:54 PM	Yes	Yeah, I think I drew a bye, and they probably aren't going to do more than one consolation round today, which means I won't have enough matches to be eliminated tonight
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 2:56 PM	No	But that's good!!
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 2:58 PM	Yes	Ehh, kind of, I think I only have to win two matches to go to the final, but wrestling sucks
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 2:58 PM	No	You could win!! That's really exciting!!
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 3:01 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, it's not going to happen though, some of these kids have been doing this forever and I can't compete with them on a technique level
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 3:02 PM	No	You'll be great. When do you go today?
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 3:03 PM	Yes	Honestly I have no idea, I haven't seen the schedule, but probably around 8ish
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 3:05 PM	No	What the hell. Do these people not know it's a national holiday? 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 3:23 PM	No	Kidding sorry... 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 3:27 PM	Yes	Haha it's fine, I'm with you
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 3:30 PM	No	It's fiiiiiiine
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 3:33 PM	No	I just miss you. And I think my everyone is tired of hearing that... :)
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 3:43 PM	Yes	I'm not tired of hearing it :)
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 3:45 PM	No	I miss you a lot....like a lot 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	It's like I'm really happy and sad at the same time and my mind can't process that 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 4:04 PM	Yes	I miss you a lot too, and don't be sad, just happy, we will celebrate valentines day together, I'm just not sure when yet
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 4:09 PM	No	It's okay that we aren't celebrating now! I think I just miss you is all
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 4:15 PM	Yes	We will see each other soon, maybe we can hang out when I get back, but not to celebrate valentines day, I don't have enough time to prepare for that today
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 4:15 PM	No	It's okay if there's no time. I'm sure you're exhausted. Oh you need preparation time? What are we doing...? 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 4:39 PM	Yes	Not yet, it doesn't even start until 6, and yes I do, and you'll see
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	Fair enough. Will you tell me what I need to wear?
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 4:45 PM	Yes	Yes, comfortable clothing
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 4:45 PM	No	Haha okay 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 4:49 PM	No	So Brian messaged me. 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 4:49 PM	No	You have to be honest 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 4:55 PM	No	I will be there if you want me to. I'm just trying to do what's best for you 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 5:04 PM	Yes	Hannah, I am afraid to lose in front of you, and I look like an idiot in a singlet with shaved legs, of course I want you here, but that is only because I would take any opportunity to spend time with you, also it's a 45 minute drive and I'll be on the mat for 6 minutes tops today
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	I really don't care if you win or lose, you're hot no matter what, and I don't mind driving. But I understand because I would feel the same way. I just want to respect whatever you want me to do 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 5:15 PM	Yes	I really appreciate that you are willing to come, but you don't need to come today, maybe if I win my match today you can come watch the semis and finals tomorrow?
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 5:15 PM	No	Okay. Good compromise. Make sure Brian knows I'm willing to come so he doesn't call me a cow or anything :) 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 6:10 PM	Yes	Haha alright, will do, what ya up to?
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 6:17 PM	No	About to shower and then totally crash my parents dinner. You?
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 7:20 PM	Yes	I was watching Louie win his match, and now I'm waiting, so much waiting in this sport
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 7:23 PM	No	That's good that he won! You really love this sport don't you? Haha how long have you been there?
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	Good luck!!
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 7:55 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, love it, got here at 315, still haven't had a match, and my first one just got bumped back at least 30 mins, thanks!
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	That sounds so enjoyable...you have to go twice tonight?
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 8:03 PM	Yes	Nope, and nope just once
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	Oh that's good ! 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	You're going to do great 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 8:07 PM	No	People are telling me I need to motivate you. How can I do that?
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Should I say I can't see you this weekend unless you win tonight? :) 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 9:11 PM	Yes	I wish I'd seen this before the match, a little push was really all I would have needed, and haha absolutely not, I lost by a few points
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 9:15 PM	No	Oh you're making me feel guilty for not texting sooner. I guess I won't see you until Monday? That was the deal?
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 9:19 PM	Yes	No, you texted me plenty early, it's my fault for not looking, and no, not the deal, there is a big positive in my losing tonight, and that is that we should have plenty of time to celebrate valentines day tomorrow :)
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	That's great :) but I do wish you had won. You still wrestle tomorrow though?
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 9:27 PM	Yes	Me to, it was a very winnable match, and yeah, I wrestle until I lose tomorrow, but my first match is a guy I've already lost to
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	You can still win! 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	You still at Wesleyan?
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 9:29 PM	Yes	No I'm almost home actually, and yeah but I'm not sure I even want too, I'd rather be with you tomorrow
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	Don't throw it please
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 9:33 PM	Yes	Haha Hannah I wouldn't do that, I'm too competitive, but I've come to terms with the fact that I am way out techniqued
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 9:34 PM	No	Yeah I know you are too competitive for that. I'm just making sure
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 9:46 PM	Yes	Besides, I know you're to competitive for that, and would be pissed at me if I did
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Yeah that's true 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 9:57 PM	Yes	Haha I can tell that you are disappointed I lost, Hannah I miss you a lot
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	I'm not at all! Promise. You're more than welcome to come over. I'm in my pajamas but 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 10:05 PM	Yes	I would really like to do that, a lot, but I would probably fall asleep in my car on the way over
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	Yeah that's concerning...
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	I know it's late 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 10:19 PM	Yes	I'm sorry Hannah, I really do want to come over, and again I feel terrible for not seeing you on valentines day
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	It's fine! People do what they want to do :) 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 10:44 PM	Yes	Hannah stop, I'm not in a great mood, and I really do want to be with you right now and I feel terrible about not seeing you today, please believe that
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 10:46 PM	No	Ok
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	You could think about how I feel for a minute though. 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 10:58 PM	Yes	That is pretty much all I've been thinking about lately
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	Okay you're right I'm sorry 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	This is going to escalate because we are both in terrible moods so let's just drop it 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 11:08 PM	Yes	It doesn't need to escalate,  please tell me how you are feeling
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 11:08 PM	Yes	I promise to listen and not get angry
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 11:09 PM	No	I'm upset. But it's my issue not yours 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 11:19 PM	Yes	Thats not how this works, our issues Hannah, and I want to talk through what is bothering you
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	I used to make a lot of excuses for guys. And I'm tired of doing that. But you shouldn't be punished for what other people have done to me 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 11:35 PM	Yes	What excuses are you making for me? And my goal with this question is purely to find out what I need to fix, not to be facetious
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	You didn't come because you're tired. 
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 11:45 PM	No	I mean it's 1145 and you're still awake. I'm not mad but I'm not going to make excuses for you
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 11:50 PM	Yes	I'm awake because I didn't want to go to sleep with you upset with me
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 11:50 PM	No	I appreciate that 
+17344782101	Feb 14, 2014, 11:55 PM	Yes	Am I good to go to sleep now then?
+13366719609	Feb 14, 2014, 11:58 PM	No	Mhmmm 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 12:00 AM	Yes	I'm not really sure what that means
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 12:00 AM	No	Yeah you have a long day tomorrow
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 12:09 AM	Yes	I can't wait to see you tomorrow, goodnight and sweet dreams Hannah 
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 12:11 AM	No	Good luck tomorrow. night! 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 10:30 AM	Yes	Hey :) can I pick you up around six o'clock tonight?
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	Sure :) 
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 10:40 AM	No	Of course you can. 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 10:45 AM	Yes	Good :)
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 10:47 AM	No	Were you worried I would say no? 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 10:49 AM	Yes	No, but it is always polite to ask
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 10:49 AM	No	Oh yeah semantics  when do you wrestle today?
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 10:53 AM	Yes	Haha I know they are very important to you, I'm already done for the day actually, waiting around to watch Brian's semi finals match and then I'm heading out
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 10:53 AM	No	I didn't realize you had to get up so early. I'm sorry I kept you awake last night. 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 10:58 AM	Yes	As long as you aren't upset with me anymore it's fine
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 10:59 AM	No	Okay. How was your match? 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 11:19 AM	Yes	Not great, I got pinned in the second period
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 11:21 AM	No	I'm sorry :/ 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 11:38 AM	Yes	It's alright, I made a dumb mistake and couldn't recover, it's okay though, glad that the season is finally over
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 11:39 AM	Yes	I apologize that is a syntacticaly awkward text
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 11:42 AM	No	Hahaa no it's okay. I'm glad you're happy though! 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 12:27 PM	Yes	Thanks, how was your parents dinner last night?
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 12:36 PM	No	Oh it was great. Then I watched house of cards with them for like 3 goes
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 12:36 PM	No	Hours
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 1:22 PM	Yes	Nice, haven't been able to get into that show, we're you up at 3 when the new season was released?
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 1:23 PM	Yes	Kidding that was actually a few day ago
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 1:23 PM	Yes	Days
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	I'm sorry my texts are just not being very intelligible today
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 1:25 PM	No	Haha no I like my sleep way too much for that. \LFNo it's fine I understand what you're saying!
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 1:25 PM	No	You're not drunk already, are you?
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 2:22 PM	Yes	Haha I'm glad you understand, and it's already 230 Hannah I'm hammered
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 2:35 PM	No	Obviously. I guess your dad will pick me up? Or will you have Sam come get me?
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 3:00 PM	Yes	I think Sam would probably be best, that way we can just keep reminding him about the whole thing
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 3:01 PM	Yes	Actually I might have Shap do it
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 3:17 PM	No	I would prefer Shap 
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 3:17 PM	No	Or better yet, Daniel 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 3:42 PM	Yes	I think I just got an acceptance letter from Vanderbilt 
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 3:45 PM	No	You think? Congratulations!!!
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 3:46 PM	Yes	I'll show you tonight, it's a little different
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 3:47 PM	No	Different as in...?
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:07 PM	Yes	Different as in its a multicultural student recruiting letter
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 4:15 PM	No	Oh that's fancy 
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 4:20 PM	No	Did you apply? 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:22 PM	Yes	Yeah, I applied regular though, not suppose to get  my decision for a couple months
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	That's great though!
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	Can I wear jeans?
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:38 PM	Yes	Yes, if you would like
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	If I would like? :)
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:39 PM	Yes	It's a semi casual restaurant
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 4:39 PM	No	Hmmm. Wanna just tell me...? :)
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:46 PM	Yes	Not particularly
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	Ooookay. What're you wearing?
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:50 PM	Yes	Jeans and a nice gray pull over
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	Okay! 
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 5:50 PM	Yes	I apologize, I am running a few minutes late 
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 5:50 PM	No	No it's fine! Are we going to see your parents? I may not be dressed appropriately for that...
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 5:51 PM	Yes	Yes, we will probably go back to my house after dinner
+13366719609	Feb 15, 2014, 11:34 PM	No	Thank you so so so so much for everything. I don't think I told you that enough. And I'm really sorry
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 12:04 AM	No	Hey
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 12:04 AM	No	Connor 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 12:05 AM	Yes	Just wanted to mess with you for a minute, and Hannah I enjoyed doing it for you, like I said, I want to make you happy, and really, its fine
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 12:07 AM	No	Funny. But I'm embarrassed and sorry 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 12:09 AM	No	But thank you. That all meant a lot to me 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 12:13 AM	No	If you're going to be this grumpy after I'm not doing what I did again...
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 12:16 AM	Yes	Hannah you mean a lot to me, and haha I'm not grumpy, I'm just respecting the fact that you are embarrassed and don't want to talk to me
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 12:19 AM	No	Kind of grumpy...
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 12:27 AM	No	I'm really sorry though 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 12:31 AM	Yes	Nah not grumpy, sleepy, and Hannah it's okay, I'll forget soon
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 12:31 AM	No	Soon as in tomorrow?
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 12:36 AM	Yes	Soon as in I already forgot about it 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 12:37 AM	No	Okay good
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 1:00 AM	No	I think I'm gonna go to bed. Thank you so much for everything and I'm sorry 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 1:13 AM	No	And I love you 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 1:46 PM	No	
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 3:01 PM	No	I'm fine. Really. No worries 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 3:26 PM	Yes	Hey, figured I'd let you feel uncomfortable for a little bit
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 3:27 PM	No	Hey, you're an ass 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 3:49 PM	Yes	Nah
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 3:54 PM	No	Yah. I sent you such a nice message. And you ignored me. So I'm on my way to Daniels for him to help me with math. 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 3:58 PM	Yes	Haha no I fell asleep, and then after I woke up you sent me a face, have fun at Daniels 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 3:59 PM	No	You make me angrier than anyone else does. 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 4:01 PM	No	Don't drown tomorrow. That would be embarrassing. 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 4:09 PM	Yes	Haha that's cause you love me, and you are setting yourself up there, but I won't because I'm nice 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 4:10 PM	No	Negative on the first part. And no go ahead. You're never offensive anyway 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 4:23 PM	Yes	What do you mean by negative on the first part?
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	What should I wear to Daniels? 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 4:31 PM	Yes	I don't want you to be cold heading over there so lots of layers, but take them all off when you get there
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 4:33 PM	No	That's what I was thinking. Do you know what kind of panties he prefers? 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 4:37 PM	Yes	I think he'd probably prefer that you just don't wear any
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 4:42 PM	Yes	No problem, really, anytime you need help with all those other guys just let me know
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 4:42 PM	No	You're the best. Really you are 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 4:46 PM	Yes	I know
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	Fine, payback for being an ass is over. 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 5:05 PM	Yes	:) love you Hannah 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 5:08 PM	No	"No it doesn't count without an ""I"" "
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 5:15 PM	Yes	I
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 5:19 PM	No	You are so obnoxious 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 5:24 PM	No	You can take care of your little problem yourself now
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 5:26 PM	Yes	I love you Hannah 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 5:28 PM	No	...
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 5:32 PM	No	At least the breakfast club is on tonight so I can have an excuse to cry 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 5:40 PM	Yes	That is a good movie
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 5:41 PM	No	Yeah and I'll watch it all alone. Or Daniel can come over I guess  
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 5:46 PM	Yes	Yeah that might be more enjoyable if he does, on a serious note I would come but I have done none of my homework, and I'm five or six days behind
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 5:49 PM	No	It's okay. I'll live :) 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 6:35 PM	Yes	Are you okay with me not coming, or are you upset again?
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	Na. I think I physically need a break from you anyways :) 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 8:41 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 8:42 PM	Yes	Sorry I was shaving, and then I didn't know how to take your comment so I figured I'd wait until you have me something else
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 8:42 PM	Yes	Gave*
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	I was trying reverse psychology. Doesn't work on you apparently 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 8:53 PM	Yes	Haha I think you need to work on you reverse psychology then, right now it kind of comes off as biting sarcastic comments that I'm afraid to respond to
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 8:53 PM	No	You're offended?? I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that. 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	I'm really sorry. 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 8:59 PM	Yes	Not offended, just worried that I might have upset you
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 8:59 PM	No	No you really haven't upset upset me yet so no worries 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:06 PM	Yes	Good, do you want to copy down my math homework for me?
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:05 PM	No	Hahaha nice
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:05 PM	No	Sorry I meant to send that to Liza Kate 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	I will if you can teach me mine. I have a test Thursday 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:08 PM	Yes	What are y'all learning right now?
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:12 PM	No	Chapter 6... :)
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	Area between curves?
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:13 PM	No	Differential equations. But I don't understand the exponential growth decay stuff part 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:13 PM	No	I really don't understand any of it honestly
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:14 PM	Yes	I actually need tutoring hours so this is good, I'll come over and help you Tuesday or Wednesday 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:17 PM	No	So you have enough self control to tutor me? 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:18 PM	Yes	Probably not, but we'll give it a go
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:19 PM	No	Great. Sounds like a plan. I'll be gross from practice so that will help. 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:22 PM	Yes	I'll give you plenty of time to shower
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:23 PM	Yes	If you want to, of course you don't have to
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	Haha no I'll shower for you. That would be nasty if I didn't 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:35 PM	No	Unless you like mud and the smell of wet grass 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:48 PM	Yes	I don't particularly like either of those things
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	That's a problem....
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:51 PM	Yes	I don't mind them, just not in the context of tutoring
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:52 PM	No	"Tutoring or ""tutoring"""
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:52 PM	Yes	Both
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:52 PM	No	Damn 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	You do realize this cuts out a lot of time?
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:56 PM	Yes	This being softball?
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:56 PM	No	Yes. And your aversion to mud 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	But seriously. I think my practices after this week will be from 430-630 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 9:59 PM	Yes	I know, and it sucks, but we'll make it work, and if we decide that it doesn't we will figure things out from there
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 10:00 PM	Yes	And Hannah I fully believe we will find a way to make it work
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 10:01 PM	No	Figure things out from there....?
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 10:06 PM	Yes	Can I retract that portion? Hannah I just want you to be happy, and I recognize that if we can't see each other much because of softball, being attached may make you miserable, something I never want to do
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 10:07 PM	No	I'm not sure what to say 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	I don't want to think about it
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 10:25 PM	Yes	I don't either and it's probably best that we don't
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 10:26 PM	No	It's just going to be embarrassing because I'll probably end up being more attached than you'll be 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 10:37 PM	Yes	I don't think that it is appropriate to have this conversation via text, besides we can cross these bridges when we get to them, we don't need to talk about them now
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	You're right. I'm sorry 
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 10:42 PM	Yes	It's okay, it's my fault for getting us on the subject, I have to get up at 515 for swimming tomorrow so ima go to bed, good night and sweet dreams, love you Hannah 
+13366719609	Feb 16, 2014, 10:45 PM	No	Good luck! You're going to be great. Please let me know how it goes. Night! Love you 
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 12:06 PM	No	How were the prelims? 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 12:12 PM	Yes	Okay, my swims were decent, but not quite enough
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 12:13 PM	No	Will you still swim this afternoon?
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 12:34 PM	Yes	Unfortunately yes, I'm swimming in two relays
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 12:36 PM	No	At least you still get to swim. My mom is harassing me so I may have to drive there after practice. 
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 12:40 PM	No	No one who didn't qualify is there right? 
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 12:42 PM	No	I'm sorry though about the prelims 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 12:46 PM	Yes	Pretty much, and it's alright, do you mean drive here after practice? Because we will be done by then
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 12:48 PM	No	Yeah well now apparently if I don't go today then I can't go anywhere for the next two weekends. My mom said I need to finish what I started. I've been to every other meet and I get it's states or whatever but it would look pathetic if I showed up. What time do you think it will be done?
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 12:50 PM	Yes	That's not good, and 6 or 7 I think
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 12:55 PM	No	Okay
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 1:00 PM	Yes	Why is she making you do that?
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 1:05 PM	No	"Because if I don't I'm a ""quitter and selfish"" "
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 1:05 PM	No	"And I'm ""part of the team"". No I'm really not..."
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 1:40 PM	Yes	I'm sorry, to be fair to her you did quit a little bit
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 1:46 PM	No	Just text me sometime around five and tell me where y'all are in the meet please. Good luck! 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 5:13 PM	Yes	Only six events to go
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 5:13 PM	No	Is it worth it to come?
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 5:15 PM	Yes	You probably wouldn't even get here until after it's over
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 5:17 PM	No	K 
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 5:20 PM	No	Thanks 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 5:48 PM	Yes	No problem, how was practice?
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 5:55 PM	No	Oh I'm a quitter so I didn't go
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 5:59 PM	No	How was the meet?
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 6:02 PM	Yes	It was alright, very long
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 6:02 PM	No	I'm sorry. How'd you do?
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 6:46 PM	Yes	Fine, the relays I was in weren't really suppose to do great and they didn't 
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 6:51 PM	No	I'm sorry. But it's okay! At least you're done?
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 7:17 PM	No	"If it makes you feel any better coach McKinney pulled up this picture of this really really heavy little kid in the batters box and showed it to everyone and said ""look I found a picture of Hannah from t ball!"""
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 7:21 PM	Yes	It does make me feel better actually, and yeah I am thrilled that it is finally over
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 7:23 PM	No	And my group conversation is all about you. So that should boost your ego!
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 7:30 PM	Yes	Debatable, odds are if it's all about me than it's not a positive conversation
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 7:34 PM	No	"Oh please. No one talks poorly about you or your ""cut body"" no worries. "
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 7:35 PM	Yes	Haha my cut body? I'm back in the gym starting tomorrow to work on that
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 7:37 PM	No	Yeah. That's a direct quote. And you don't need to do that! You're perfect the way you are. I sense you're depressed. So am I. You should come over and we can make each other feel better!! 
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 7:37 PM	No	And by feel better I mean you do my math homework 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:00 PM	Yes	Haha as much as I would like to do your math homework, I am currently failing macro and have a chapter and a half left to read, along with several nights of multi variable 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:05 PM	Yes	For the record, I am all about the making each other feel better thing
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	So you're all about doing my math homework???
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Kidding. Good to know
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:16 PM	Yes	Hannah I am failing macro
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:16 PM	Yes	This is not good
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	Connor. Is that a complaining about it text or you need to leave me alone text? 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:18 PM	Yes	Definitely complaining
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	I'm sure you're not failing 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:18 PM	Yes	We've had one quiz and I got a 59, I am failing
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	It's okay!! You'll be fine. You can bring it up 
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	You're an intelligent person. You'll be ok!
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:22 PM	Yes	I hope, it really would be a downer to get an admittance rescinded because of that class
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	I think that rarely happens. He just hates me so much...
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:27 PM	Yes	He doesn't hate you Hannah, it's more like a complete lack or respect
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:27 PM	Yes	of*
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:30 PM	No	Yeah. It's definitely some of that. And then I got sarcastic and bitchy and that doesn't help 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:34 PM	Yes	
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	That's kind of depressing...Did you read his comment for me for second quarter??
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:36 PM	Yes	How would I have read that Hannah?
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:37 PM	No	Oh because I showed someone and I couldn't remember who mr sassy 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:38 PM	Yes	Sorry, would you send it to me?
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:39 PM	No	Apology accepted
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:39 PM	No	
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:39 PM	No	He talked about my project and then went in for the kill 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:44 PM	Yes	"I think what he was really feeling is, ""economics is a really challenging subject for her and women in general, nevertheless..."""
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	Wow. Connor you always know just what to say to make me feel better 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 8:48 PM	Yes	I try very hard :)
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	But seriously he's an ass. 
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	I know :)
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	I keep waiting for him to say something that I can take to a lawyer 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 9:00 PM	Yes	Haha you should really do that so no one else has to suffer him, hey I hate to ask this, but do you mind if we don't text for like an hour? I'm not the best multi tasker and I am far more interested in talking to you and it is killing my productivity
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 9:05 PM	No	Haha of course. Don't let macro kill you 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 10:08 PM	Yes	I apologize but it may be a little bit more than an hour, I just finished my math and still have the chapter of macro
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 10:17 PM	No	No you're totally fine. I'm trying to do everything I should have done over the past 6 days 
+17344782101	Feb 17, 2014, 11:26 PM	Yes	Finally finished macro, and am going to sleep, night, love you
+13366719609	Feb 17, 2014, 11:28 PM	No	Love you too
+13366719609	Feb 18, 2014, 11:58 PM	No	I don't actually need a few days 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:04 AM	Yes	Good :) I was actually just about to give up on giving you space
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:06 AM	Yes	Literally five more minutes and I was going to text you
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:06 AM	Yes	Did you talk to your parents?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:07 AM	No	Literally?
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:11 AM	Yes	Are you making fun of me or asking a question?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:11 AM	No	Asking a question 
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:11 AM	No	I did talk to my mom. Did you?
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:13 AM	Yes	Yeah, she was not very happy with me, is my reputation with your mother ruined?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:15 AM	No	Yeah what did she say? Na. Like I said she can't judge
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:20 AM	Yes	She half jokingly called me a shit, and that's not true, you know she thanked me for how well I treat you earlier today?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:25 AM	No	Ah good. She appreciates how you treat me 
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:25 AM	No	Or how you normally do
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:27 AM	Yes	How I will treat you going forward
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:29 AM	No	Fair enough  sorry I hit you 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:30 AM	Yes	You aren't and shouldn't be, I deserved it
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:32 AM	No	I am sorry!
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:38 AM	Yes	Again I deserved it, Hannah ima go to sleep, good night, love you
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:39 AM	No	Ugh Connor 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:39 AM	Yes	Ugh what?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:39 AM	No	We are ok?
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:43 AM	Yes	On my end, I love you Hannah, and I really want us to be together, if you are as well then yes
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:43 AM	No	Oooookie dokie :) 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:46 AM	Yes	Good night, love you Hannah
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:47 AM	No	Night....love you too....
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:52 AM	No	Wait 
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:52 AM	No	Wait
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:55 AM	Yes	Wait for?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 12:55 AM	No	What about that other girl 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 12:58 AM	Yes	You are the only girl Hannah, night
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 1:01 AM	No	I believe you. Night
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 4:11 PM	No	I love you. You know that right?
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 4:19 PM	Yes	Yes, and you know that I love you?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 6:01 PM	No	Yes I hope :) 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 6:21 PM	Yes	I do :) how was practice?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 6:25 PM	No	I know. It was good! I would have rather taken a nap with you but it's okay. What are you up to?
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 6:29 PM	Yes	I would rather you have done that as well, and nothing, just got back from Gabo's, you?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 6:33 PM	No	Just got home! My math test is tomorrow...
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 6:35 PM	Yes	Your gonna kill it, but if you'd like me to pretend to help you, your welcome to come over, I can't go out again tonight though I am falling too far behind
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 6:37 PM	No	I would love for you to pretend to help me but I know you have a lot to do
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 6:45 PM	Yes	I appreciate that your being considerate, but really if you want to come, I would not mind in the slightest
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 6:47 PM	No	So you want me to come? When are y'all eating? I could come after 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 6:55 PM	Yes	Yes, and we're already done actually
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 6:55 PM	No	I should probably shower...
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 7:00 PM	Yes	Maybe
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	Yeahhhh...
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	I'll text you when I'm about to leave? If you're sure it's okay I com e 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 7:01 PM	Yes	Sounds good, and of course it's okay
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 7:35 PM	No	I'm about to leave if that's okay
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 7:35 PM	Yes	See you in a little bit :)

+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 10:42 PM	Yes	That's not good, I will find it for you
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 10:42 PM	No	My moms giving me hell about it....
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 10:42 PM	Yes	Haha really?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 10:42 PM	No	And she asked what happened to my hair...
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 10:43 PM	Yes	You should have told her I rubbed a balloon on your head
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 10:43 PM	No	Why didn't I think of that?
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 10:45 PM	Yes	I don't know, she totally would have bought it
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 10:46 PM	No	She said it looked like I had been in a wind tunnel
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 10:49 PM	Yes	Driving with the window down?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	She asked if my earring miraculously flew out the passengers window 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 10:51 PM	Yes	Sounds like a lot of questions
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	Yeah. I told you... 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 10:56 PM	Yes	Haha was she mad or just making fun of you?
+13366719609	Feb 19, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	Making fun fortunately 
+17344782101	Feb 19, 2014, 11:13 PM	Yes	That's good, hey ima go to sleep, good night, love you Hannah

+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	Wow pulling out the smiley faces? It was good!
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 6:34 PM	Yes	Only pulling out the smiley faces because thinking about you makes me happy, and that's good!
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 6:34 PM	No	Uhuh... :) but yeah I think we will be good! He wants us practicing for four hours Saturday...
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 6:42 PM	Yes	Haha that sounds miserable, what are you doing tonight?
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 6:42 PM	No	Yeah I know...I think I need I go get some new cleats and that's it. You?
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:01 PM	Yes	I think my sister and I might go to the play, haha, and that's it?
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	Oh wow. Shap asked me to go about seven times... Yes that's it sassy pants
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:03 PM	Yes	So you wouldn't go to the play with me then?
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	Nope 
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:04 PM	No	I need an engraved invitation actually 
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:08 PM	Yes	I love you, but I'm not sure I could get that to you tonight, and actually you said nope so I told my brother that he didn't have to go which means I have to go home and watch him
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	I was kidding. I'm about to shower. 
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:10 PM	Yes	About the invitation or being willing to hang out with me?
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	I'll do whatever you want
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	I'm so sorry
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:12 PM	Yes	Assuming that second text wasn't for me? And I think you are being facetious, but what I want is typically going to be to spend time with you
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:12 PM	No	No I'm so sorry that you left your brother at home 
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:12 PM	No	What do you want to do tonight?
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:15 PM	Yes	Oh, and I think I was pretty clear in the last text, but just in case, I want to see you
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:14 PM	No	Should I come to the play? 
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:18 PM	Yes	If you'd like, I can't though because I have to be at home with me brother
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:18 PM	Yes	My
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:17 PM	No	Yeah that's my fault. I'm sorry

+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:21 PM	Yes	That's perfect, just come to my house like that
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:21 PM	No	Funny
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:21 PM	No	Seriously though what do you want me to do?
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:23 PM	Yes	Whatever you want, my parents are gone till nine though
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	That's not helpful. 
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	are you allowed to have me there without them home?
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:27 PM	Yes	Yes 
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:27 PM	No	Do I believe that?
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:27 PM	No	You need to just tell me what to do 
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:28 PM	Yes	You do, and haha not going to do that
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	I legitimately need to do work. So you would have to control yourself
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:29 PM	Yes	But you know what I want
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:29 PM	Yes	Okay, I can do that after 9
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	....
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	I'll just look really ugly then you'll have no problem 
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:30 PM	Yes	Not possible
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:31 PM	No	Very. Trust me
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:33 PM	Yes	This is not a challenge, but I doubt it, when are you coming?
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	9:05
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:36 PM	Yes	How about 8 actually?
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	How about I get dressed ?
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:37 PM	Yes	Really not a necessity, but fine, see you at 8
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:37 PM	No	And it's still a few days
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:40 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:40 PM	Yes	In short it has been a few days
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	Not according to me :)
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:42 PM	Yes	Fair enough
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	Woah woah woah did you just agree?
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:47 PM	Yes	Yes

+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:51 PM	No	I'm about to leave. It's as bad as it's gonna get
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:52 PM	Yes	Your still going to be beautiful
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	You'll see

+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 7:57 PM	Yes	No, just in love
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:58 PM	No	Practically the same thing?
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 7:59 PM	No	Okay directions from the sh road so I don't have to take forever 
+17344782101	Feb 20, 2014, 8:00 PM	Yes	Turn right onto sunny dell, and then left onto coral garden lane, right onto white hawk
+13366719609	Feb 20, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	I'm here...
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	Hey...so...

+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 9:40 PM	Yes	Yeah it would be better if you were laying on a couch with me 
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	Yeah that's what I was thinking...but you're busyyyyy
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 10:01 PM	No	I miss you 
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 10:01 PM	No	Really just your body heat but it's the same thing right?
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 10:09 PM	Yes	I'm not really sure that it is, but that's okay, and actually, I miss you quite a bit as well
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	I miss you a lot. 
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 10:32 PM	Yes	I miss you too, we might be done soonish
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 10:34 PM	No	soonish? I may fall asleep in my basement soon
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 10:43 PM	Yes	Soonish meaning not that soon at all actually, and I would love to join you, but I doubt your father would let me in right now
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	Eh semantics 
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 10:46 PM	No	Can you ask Daniel what time I'm supposed to be at school though?
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 10:48 PM	Yes	He just left actually, but David thinks 815ish
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 10:49 PM	No	Thanks 
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 11:06 PM	Yes	How's your couch?
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 11:34 PM	No	Sorry I just woke up. So much better if you were here
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 11:35 PM	Yes	That's fine, and go to sleep, you have to get up early
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 11:35 PM	No	I just wanted to sleep on you.... 
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 11:36 PM	Yes	I just want you to do that
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	It's unfortunate 
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 11:41 PM	No	That we can't 
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 11:41 PM	No	Why 815 if it starts at 9? 
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 11:41 PM	No	I'm very confused
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 11:43 PM	Yes	It is, and that is a good question
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 11:43 PM	No	Eh Daniel said set up. It's going to be a long day tomorrow 
+13366719609	Feb 21, 2014, 11:52 PM	No	I have to go to bed. I love you a lot! Night
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 12:13 AM	Yes	I'm sorry, good night, love you!
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 10:59 AM	Yes	How's the orchestra thing going?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 11:12 AM	No	Good! I'm just leaving actually so I can get something to eat before practice. How're you?
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 11:37 AM	Yes	I'm good, how long is your practice today?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 11:38 AM	No	It's supposed to be 1-5 there may be a mutiny. 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 11:49 AM	Yes	You should make that happen, 4 hours is absurd
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 11:53 AM	No	And the coach selected captains yesterday and he gave Riley one. And literally everyone on the team Is furious so I'm trying to deal with that
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 11:54 AM	No	And how can we practice for four hours??
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 11:57 AM	Yes	Gave Riley one as in didn't give you one? Or everyone just hates this Riley person? And I'm not really sure to be honest, you'll probably just end up passed out on the ground
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 12:01 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 12:06 PM	Yes	I'll have to check and make sure with my dad when he gets home, but I think that works :)
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 12:06 PM	No	Connnnnor 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 12:11 PM	Yes	What does that mean?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 12:10 PM	No	Okay :)
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 12:12 PM	No	You don't have to go if you don't want to!
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 12:27 PM	Yes	I do want to :)
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 12:44 PM	No	Are you sure?
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 12:59 PM	Yes	I'm a little bit nervous, but yeah, are we going out or eating at your house?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 2:07 PM	No	Probably go out
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 2:09 PM	No	We will just be talking about softball and the house I'm sure. I'll keep the conversation going  with complaints about coach no worries
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 2:09 PM	Yes	Haha alright, how are you texting during practice?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 2:09 PM	No	...water...
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 2:09 PM	No	This fucking coach though 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 2:12 PM	Yes	Haha so glad that I am done with sports
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 4:39 PM	No	I just :) how are you?
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 4:58 PM	Yes	I'm good, having another band practice
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 5:11 PM	No	Oh yeah that's what they said this morning. I don't think we can go to dinner until 830. That okay?
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 6:06 PM	Yes	Yeah that's fine
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:08 PM	No	Do you want me to pick you up or something? We don't have to ride with my family
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 6:08 PM	Yes	Whatever works best for you is fine
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:08 PM	No	You just tell me :)
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:09 PM	No	It's been a rough day :) 
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:10 PM	No	I may quit 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 6:25 PM	Yes	Alone time with you sounds fantastic, so if you want to pick me up that works, if not that's okay, don't quit, you can make it
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:25 PM	No	Okay I'll pick you up at like 815ish? Sometime like that. I know I can make it but I just don't know if it's worth it. 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 6:27 PM	Yes	Are you saying that you don't want me to come tonight?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:28 PM	No	No no I want to see you really badly. I miss you. I'm just subtly warning you that I'm kinda tired and may be a little frustrated. 
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:34 PM	No	Are you trying to get out of coming? :)
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 6:37 PM	Yes	Haha fair enough, and no, I'm a little nervous but that's okay
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:37 PM	No	So that counts as a warning? You have nothing to be nervous about! Why're you nervous?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:40 PM	No	I just really need to go get drunk but that's not going to happen tonight. 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 6:49 PM	Yes	Because I don't really know what to talk about, and I know very little about softball and houses, and why can't you get drunk tonight?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	It's going to be fine!! I promise! I'll keep the conversation going and you'll be okay. You're intelligent!  Because I have no where to get drunk. 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 6:52 PM	Yes	Have you looked? They typically aren't that hard to find, and a lot of parents are out of town this weekend
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:51 PM	No	Na. It's not worth it probably 
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:51 PM	No	And then it's finding a ride and all that shit 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 6:59 PM	Yes	No, you can just get Shap to do it, and just so you know, I don't have a problem with you going to parties without me if it's easier for you to get invited to them that way
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 6:57 PM	No	Funny. Thanks for the offer, boyfriend. Haha no I don't get invited 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 7:04 PM	Yes	Haha I'm sure you do, and I can drive you if you want
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:04 PM	No	Nope 
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:07 PM	No	You'd rather Shap have a drunk Hannah than Connor have a drunk Hannah. That's fine! I can make that happen I'm sure 
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 7:08 PM	Yes	I think watching Shap get rejected by a drunk Hannah might be more entertaining than taking care of a drunk Hannah
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:09 PM	No	I think you're an ass 
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	"And I don't need to be ""taken care of"" thank you very much "
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 7:17 PM	Yes	Sassy, and that's not very nice 
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:21 PM	No	You're not very nice
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 7:23 PM	Yes	That's true I suppose
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:23 PM	No	It's okay. I still like you
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 7:32 PM	Yes	:)
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 7:32 PM	Yes	I like you too
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:34 PM	No	Oh wow thanks...
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 7:44 PM	Yes	So sassy, how do I need to be dressed for this dinner?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:45 PM	No	I warned you my mood. And I didn't have time to sleep so it's progressively getting worse. We are going to where we went to formal. I think jake has on jeans and a collared shirt. It doesn't really matter
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:46 PM	No	I'll be fine :) I'm just kid isn't 
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:46 PM	No	Kidding 
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	Is it okay if I leave soon?
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 7:58 PM	Yes	Yeah, are you sure about the jeans?
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	Oh yeah it's totally fine 
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 7:59 PM	No	I'll text you when I get there so I don't awkwardly stand on the porch
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 8:02 PM	Yes	Sounds good, see ya in a bit :)
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	I'm here
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 8:19 PM	Yes	Coming down
+13366719609	Feb 22, 2014, 8:20 PM	No	Slow walker
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 3:51 PM	Yes	Hey :) how ya doin?
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 3:56 PM	No	Oh solid. I was getting worried 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 3:59 PM	Yes	Why would you be doing that?
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	Because 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	You're okay?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:08 PM	Yes	Yeah, I've just been working on stuff all day and knew that I wouldn't get anything done after I started texting you
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 4:11 PM	No	Oh yeah I've done nothing today. 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 4:11 PM	No	They reached an agreement on the house 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:22 PM	Yes	Congrats! I still haven't really figured out whether you are excited or ambivalent about that by the way
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 4:30 PM	No	Yeah I haven't really decided either. I think I'm excited but it's just weird to me because we moved a ton when I was little for my dads job and so it's strange to just be doing it because we want to you know?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:43 PM	Yes	Yeah I've never really heard of people doing that to be honest, on the bright side if you hate it you won't have to live in it very long
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	Yeah apparently it's a thing though! 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	So you think you'll be doing my macro tonight? 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 5:03 PM	Yes	Maybe, as productive as today has been, I haven't actually done any of the things I need to do yet 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	Dammit 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 5:26 PM	No	How about a nap?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 5:34 PM	Yes	It's definitely a possibility
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 5:36 PM	No	Hm interesting 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 6:10 PM	Yes	We aren't really the best at napping though
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 6:11 PM	Yes	You get to worried when I'm not trying to hook up with you
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 6:13 PM	No	No we would make a concerted effort. I'm really sore from practice anyway. Yeah that was just last night. I thought me and my family had scared you. 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 6:36 PM	Yes	You realize that by definition we both have to be on board for a concerted effort, right?
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 6:40 PM	No	Wow you're not on board? 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 6:46 PM	Yes	I am, still not convinced that you are
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	I am! 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:15 PM	Yes	Haha are you coming over then?
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 7:14 PM	No	Yeah see that involves driving... So... :) 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:20 PM	Yes	Are you insinuating that I should come to you?
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	Do you want to? 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:33 PM	Yes	If you want me to, but I would prefer to be at my house
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 7:34 PM	No	Can I ask why?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:39 PM	Yes	No
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:40 PM	Yes	Kidding, you can
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	Why?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:41 PM	Yes	Because I really like the work setup I have going, and I am waiting to hear back from someone so that I can send something to Gabo so that we can finally get an app on the App Store
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	Hmm you sound busy 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:45 PM	Yes	Not particularly, I just need to be ready when I get a response
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 7:52 PM	No	Hmmmm so I need to get dressed, look presentable, and drive?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 8:00 PM	Yes	Actually just the driving thing, I really don't care if you are dressed or presentable
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	Yeah but your parents doooooo
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 8:07 PM	No	We haven't eaten yet
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 8:10 PM	Yes	My parents are going to be asleep before you even get here
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	That's classy of me 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Do you want me to come over?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 8:20 PM	Yes	I do, but you should eat first because dinner is important
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 8:21 PM	No	It's not that important but yeah I was planning on it
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 8:30 PM	Yes	It's pretty important
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	Eh yeah I'm almost done 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 8:39 PM	No	Seriously do I need to get dressed?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 8:48 PM	Yes	Mom just went to bed and my dads going to sleep in ten, haha you need to have clothes on but you don't have to be presentable
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 8:56 PM	No	I'm leaving if that's okay
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:00 PM	Yes	It's okay, but my parents just told me they think I need to take a break tonight
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:00 PM	Yes	I want you to come, but it's your call
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	If your parents don't want me there I won't come 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	I'll see you Tuesday 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:05 PM	Yes	Shit, I just realized I phrased that incorrectly, and I am sorry, my mom thinks that I need to sleep tonight, not to take a break, please don't interpret it that way, both my parents really like you
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:05 PM	No	Ok
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:08 PM	Yes	Hannah I am serious they really do, my mom is just worried that I am going to get sick from sleep deprivation, and I want you to come and you are still welcome to, just probably not as late as last night
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	Yeah I needed to be home by twelve anyway but I'll see you Tuesday 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:17 PM	Yes	Hannah stop
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	Stop what?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:20 PM	Yes	Being passive aggressive 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	It's what I do. Sorry. I really didn't feel like driving but I wanted to see you and I got that text when I was on robinhood so sorry if it made me feel a little shitty 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:23 PM	Yes	Then you should have came! I told you I still wanted to come I was just giving you a heads up, I expect you to tell me how your parents feel so why would I not do the same?
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	If your parents don't want me there I wasn't going to come...
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:24 PM	Yes	They didn't say they didn't want you there, just that they wanted me to sleep
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	In order for you to sleep I can't be there so no they don't want me there 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:26 PM	Yes	That's not true, you just would have had to leave earlier, you do understand that they like you right?
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Yep 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	You could have said that instead of saying you need a break 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:29 PM	Yes	I know, I'm sorry, I'm not use to watching my semantics, and I didn't realize until after I sent it that I was conveying a message I had no intention of conveying
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:30 PM	No	Okay 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:42 PM	Yes	Hannah I love you
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	Yep 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:45 PM	No	It's nice coming home five minutes after I left though and trying to find an excuse for my parents 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:46 PM	No	Other than you disinviting me 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:48 PM	Yes	Hannah what do you want me to say? I am sorry
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 9:52 PM	No	Okay thanks 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:58 PM	Yes	Goodnight, clearly everything I say right now is just going to piss you off so I give up, see you Tuesday
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 10:00 PM	No	What do you want me to say? I love you too but you hurt my feelings and when people do that I get mean and bitchy so I'm sorry for that
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 10:00 PM	No	And I really wanted to see you and it felt like you didn't have the same sentiment 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:12 PM	Yes	I know, and I don't handle that well and I'm sorry for that, and don't take this the wrong way Hannah but to be honest I didn't, I am an introvert, I need to spend a fair amount of time by myself, I love you and it has nothing to do with you, it's just the way I am and always have been, are there times when I wish I wasn't that way? Absolutely, but there really isn't much I can do about it
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 10:14 PM	No	I understand needing to spend time alone. But you're okay with hanging out with me if I'm giving you head? 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:21 PM	Yes	I love hanging out with you regardless of what we are doing
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:22 PM	Yes	I just can't be around people all of the time, even people I love
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	Okay Connor 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 10:29 PM	No	Whatever makes you happy
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:31 PM	Yes	Goodnight Hannah, I love you 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	I love you too. In the future though if you don't want to see me please don't invite me. I'm not mad just hurt okay?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 11:13 PM	Yes	I understand and I won't do it again, I'm really sorry that I hurt you, I actually do need to go to bed now, so good night, I love you
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 11:15 PM	No	Sorry if I was rude
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 11:16 PM	Yes	It's fine, I was being plenty rude myself, I really do need to go to sleep now though, I'm exhausted
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 11:17 PM	No	It is a shame though. I was going to bring condoms 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 11:19 PM	Yes	No, you don't need condoms to take a nap Hannah, just a heads up I am going to keep responding as long as you do but I really want to go to sleep
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	Ouch 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 11:21 PM	No	It's slightly offensive you didn't jump on the offer 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 11:22 PM	Yes	Maybe, but it would me fore offensive to disregard your desire to wait until after the dr
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 11:22 PM	Yes	More
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	Hopefully we can make it that long without killing each other 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	Good night! 
+13366719609	Feb 23, 2014, 11:34 PM	No	I love you 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 11:36 PM	Yes	We can do it, I love you too
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 10:57 AM	No	Are you sure we can do it? And I'll trust you enough? 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 11:08 AM	No	Never mind. Let's ignore that 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 1:08 PM	No	I'm not trying to be needy but I need you to tell me everything is okay
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 2:38 PM	Yes	Hannah I love you, and everything is okay 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 3:26 PM	No	Are you just saying that because I asked you to?
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 3:40 PM	No	Never mind 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 3:45 PM	Yes	Stop over thinking things, I thought we agreed to just let stuff happen, I am content now and don't foresee any issues, please stop worrying, I love you
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 3:48 PM	No	I know I'm overthinking. I'm going to stop and enjoy it. I love you too 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 3:49 PM	No	And I'm just warning you if you're going to want to hang out anytime soon you may have to come here. 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 4:03 PM	Yes	I am happy to come to you, not sure when I am going to be able to this week though
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 4:05 PM	No	No I don't think I'll have any time either. And this weekend may be up in the air because I got in an argument with my mom this morning. If we are being honest...
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 4:15 PM	No	Okay I'm about to go to practice. I love you 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 4:43 PM	Yes	What about? Have fun, love you too
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 6:40 PM	No	It's stupid. How're you?
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 7:02 PM	Yes	I'm alright, Gabo and I just had a big setback with the app, tell me
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	I'm sorry. What happened? We just started talking about softball and I don't know it blew up. I get really rude and it's a problem so I'm really sorry about everything I said to you at Starbucks the other night. 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 7:23 PM	Yes	I was trying to fix something, and I end up breaking the whole thing, and I'm sorry, was it about not playing? And you don't need to apologize, you have never said anything that you didn't have the right to say
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 7:28 PM	Yes	Ended
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 7:29 PM	Yes	Also I apologize for taking so long to respond I was driving
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 7:32 PM	No	I'm sorry :( I'm sure you can fix it!! Yeah it's fine. she doesn't care what I do but I just get really wrapped up in sports and coach Mckinney is just being... :) \LFNo you're fine!
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 7:52 PM	Yes	I'm not sure I can unfortunately :/ and I'm sorry, at least y'all have a chance of winning a state championship and you have that to look forward too?
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 7:54 PM	No	I'm really sorry Yeah! That's a positive :) 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 7:55 PM	Yes	Have you done macro yet?
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 7:55 PM	No	Yeah but I really need to study. Have you?
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 7:55 PM	No	I haven't really done any other work though 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 8:06 PM	Yes	Haven't even started, what are you studying for?
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	That's my boy! I need to study for macro so I don't get another D 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 8:20 PM	Yes	That's what I get for being productive yesterday, and don't worry,I'm not going to make any jokes around the second part of that text
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	Yeah! Wow you're growing up! You won't if you ever want me to touch you again! 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 8:26 PM	No	I just want to sleeeeeep and not study 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 8:45 PM	Yes	You don't meant that, and you should sleep, you will do fine tomorrow, and even if you don't, is it really that big if a deal?
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 8:50 PM	No	I'm pretending I mean it. \LFI can't fail the class. That would be bad bad bad 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 8:54 PM	Yes	As long as we both know that you are pretending, and I suppose
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	Yeah and if I'm not pretending?
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 8:56 PM	Yes	That scenario is irrelevant
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 8:58 PM	No	Hmm is it? 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 8:59 PM	Yes	Yes, I just realized I was suppose to do one of the those in class essays I missed for homework this weekend :/
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	It may not be. \LFOh buddy....I'm sorry....
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:05 PM	Yes	Whether or not it is, I am absolutely positive that neither of us wants it to be, and yeah, I don't think I'm going to, teen wolf is on tonight and I'm on the last episode of the 2nd season of chuck
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:05 PM	No	You're unbelievable 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:16 PM	Yes	No, I am right
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	No no. Unbelievable
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	Wait right about what? 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	I was talking about how you're unbelievable about English. You're right about the other. 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:19 PM	Yes	Haha we are on the same page then, and ehh, she's only counting two of the papers remember?
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	Oh that's true...
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	The thing is she should hate you. But she doesn't it...you just must have an appeal to all women. 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:50 PM	Yes	You realize you just equated yourself to pattie
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:51 PM	Yes	
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:53 PM	No	No. Equating myself to her would only be accurate if you had an appeal to me. It just must be difficult to be so attractive 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:53 PM	No	I'm just ignoring that 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:56 PM	Yes	No I need your opinion, and it is, quite difficult really, not sure how I do it
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	Who are you trying to show that to...? \LFYeah. But having people drooling when they look at you must get annoying 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	the sad part is I'm only partially kidding 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:59 PM	Yes	You are just all about stroking my ego right now, I like it, and I was going to put it on my definitions...
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:59 PM	Yes	
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 10:01 PM	No	Yeah I don't know why I am. Don't get used to it. \LFYeah the cat was probably a good move. You're so strange 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:22 PM	Yes	Too late, I am already used to it, and if I recall correctly it's actually people (just you) drooling on me while they try to sleep that I get more of
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 10:24 PM	No	That's your fault then \LFI don't understand that second part of that
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:50 PM	Yes	Yeah I couldn't quite figure out how to group my thoughts, did you type the frqs?
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 10:53 PM	No	Mhmmm
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:55 PM	Yes	That's not an answer
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 10:55 PM	No	It's a mumbled yes
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 10:55 PM	No	It's almost 11. Way past my bedtime 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 10:56 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:57 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:58 PM	Yes	You should go to sleep then, and hey you got points on the board
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	You're taking a bath...? 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:02 PM	Yes	No I'm playing with emojis
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 11:02 PM	No	Let's not play with the bath emojis 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:05 PM	Yes	
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 11:05 PM	No	why are you videotaping yourself...?
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:10 PM	Yes	Actually that would be both of us, and If I'm not mistaken it looks like there is a third person...
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	I am so confused and disturbed right now 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:16 PM	Yes	That's fair, honestly I just sent random bath tub emojis and threw in the camera cause it was there
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 11:19 PM	No	That makes me feel a little bit better
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:27 PM	Yes	That's good :)
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 11:30 PM	No	
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 11:30 PM	No	Connor the video camera is no where close to the bath...nice try. you're so strange. 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:38 PM	Yes	Yes, I need to get up early to do homework tomorrow so ima go to bed, good night, I love you Hannah 
+13366719609	Feb 24, 2014, 11:50 PM	No	Hmmm good luck with that. I love you too
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 3:13 PM	No	Thank you for considering to come :)
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 3:20 PM	No	You can come if you want. I'm really sorry if I was rude about it
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 3:24 PM	Yes	You weren't, and I can come if you want me too
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 3:28 PM	No	No you do whatever you want. I really don't care one way or another. It's just a scrimmage so we may not be playin like a game. 
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 3:34 PM	No	No big deal I promise 
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 3:53 PM	Yes	Are you sure? I really do want to come support you, I just have a meeting with Gabo, band practice, and 2 bio labs, a Stanford update form, and cona app to do
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 4:39 PM	No	No you're totally fined
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 4:42 PM	No	Fine 
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	I promise thank you though 
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	It's good you didn't come 
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 9:11 PM	Yes	I am assuming it didn't go well then? Also I apologize for taking so long to respond, I ended up laying in bed for a very long time last night and got no sleep and am quite out of it
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 9:11 PM	Yes	Laying in bed awake*
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 9:11 PM	Yes	Suppose it doesn't make sense without that word
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	I don't want to complain. But honestly he's merciless with me. But I'll get used to it. I'm sorry :/ is that why you started snoring in English?? :)
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 9:25 PM	Yes	It's only because he knows  you're talented, and that is exactly the reason actually, this week might kill me
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	thanks. But you haven't seen me play and we have a lot of good players. Yeah same. And  then Friday I have a game in Charlotte and a scrimmage Saturday noting at north Davidson. Everyone is so mad. 
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 9:35 PM	No	That was complaining...sorry 
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 9:38 PM	Yes	It's fine, Hannah if you need to vent I am here for you, besides I complain to you plenty, I'm sorry that your coach is such a hardass :/
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	Thanks you don't complain that much though. I just have to not let it get to me because he's trying to get a reaction out of me and I can't let that happen
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 10:10 PM	Yes	Well you could probably let that happen actually
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 10:15 PM	No	But then I'll look like the bad guy for having a poor attitude 
+13366719609	Feb 25, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	I'm about to crash. Good night I love you sleep well 
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 10:24 PM	Yes	I love you too, good night
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	I hope the sound check went well! You're going to do great!! 
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 9:05 PM	Yes	Just finished, and haha thanks, I hope we do, I got Josiah to show up
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	That's good!! I told you it would be fine 
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	That sounded like I told you so. Which it wasn't 
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 9:24 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 9:25 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 9:25 PM	Yes	The room is huge, and there are going to be so many people there
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 9:30 PM	No	That looks awesome! Y'all are going to sound good in there. You've been practicing a lot and whenever you set your mind to something you do it will. You're going to be great :$
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 9:59 PM	Yes	I appreciate your confidence and support :) how goes studying for the stoltz shit show tomorrow?
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 10:07 PM	No	Anytime! Oh well I've been studying since I got home from our lovely scrimmage which isn't long. It's going to be bad...
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 10:26 PM	Yes	This has been by far the most stressful week of the year
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	I know. But you're going to be okay! You'll get through it. Can we hang out Saturday night?
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	Only if you want 
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 10:37 PM	Yes	I am honestly not entirely sure that that is true, and I definitely want to do that :) what did you have in mind?
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	Hey you can to get through it! \LF\LFIt doesn't matter to me. I have four scrimmages that morning and afternoon...so I should be game for anything that doesn't involve softball 
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 11:07 PM	Yes	That's unfortunate, I only wanted to hang out if we could play softball
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	Yeah I know you wanted to beat me at something else but I don't know if I could emotionally handle that Saturday 
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 11:31 PM	Yes	I'd imagine you might be pretty physically exhausted as well, maybe we just go to dinner and movie then?
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	Eh yeah maybe a little. Sounds good I'll just need to make sure my mom doesn't need anything for the auction that night 
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 11:41 PM	Yes	Okay :) I'm about to crash, good night, love you
+13366719609	Feb 26, 2014, 11:43 PM	No	Night love you too 
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 11:58 AM	No	Good Luck!! You're going to do great!!! 
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 7:44 PM	No	I hope it went well!
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 7:51 PM	Yes	I think it did, how was your scrimmage?
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:05 PM	Yes	Or did you just have practice today?
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 8:09 PM	No	Sorry all I got was a text about practice? I think my phones messing up
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:11 PM	Yes	It might be, I said I think it went well, and then asked how your scrimmage went
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	That's good! I'm sure it was great. We just had practice. It was okay. I'll have to fill you in on all the drama sometime if you can put up with listening to it
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:21 PM	Yes	I suppose we could spend a little bit of time on that on Saturday
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	Hmm you suppose a bit?
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	Did anything exciting happen this afternoon??
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:41 PM	Yes	Yes, just a bit, and not particularly, it went well, my dad paid us a lot of money under the table, and now we have enough to fund the recording of our ep
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 8:47 PM	No	That's good! I meant exciting like fan girls exciting. But that's great too!
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:51 PM	Yes	Haha there were a couple of forty year old women who were shocked and aggravated by how young we are but that's about it, we actually just found a message in our inbox about being a 1d cover band for a 13 year olds birthday party
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:51 PM	Yes	I suppose that is interesting
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	Yeah I'm sure they were aggravated. That's great!
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:59 PM	Yes	I've started reading your texts in your voice, and everything sounds very sassy 
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	Hahaha no. I promise they're not! 
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	I am aggravated but not with you at all. I'm sorry if they sound like that 
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	It's fine really, I've been on a bit of a tirade lately and have managed to alienate many of my friends, so I totally understand where you are coming from
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	My point being that I probably come off a heck of a lot more sarcastic and obnoxious than I realize
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 9:14 PM	No	Haha I know you've been stressed. But I'm not upset with you I promise. 
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 10:10 PM	Yes	Good :) I don't know if I could handle you being upset with me at the moment
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	Want to test it?
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	Kidding. If you need to take some anger out though please punch my coach 
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	Or Mr. Perry. I told him today that I don't appreciate being patronized. I'm really just getting on everyone's bad side now. 
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 10:30 PM	Yes	I'll do that, and good for you, how'd that go over?
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	"The air was sucked out of the room and there were a few ""ooo""s but whatever. "
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 10:43 PM	Yes	I am really upset that you couldn't wait to do that until I was there
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 10:45 PM	No	"I'm sorry. I couldn't let the opportunity pass. I started with ""I'm not a raging feminist but..."" "
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 10:55 PM	Yes	Did he cry?
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 11:00 PM	No	No I wish. I think he actually just patronized me more.
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 11:00 PM	No	Question and don't get offended
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 11:13 PM	Yes	That unfortunate, and what's the question?
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 11:18 PM	No	Did anyone say anything to you about anything for Josie tomorrow night?
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 11:21 PM	Yes	No, but why would I be offended? Haven't really ever talked to Josie 
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 11:23 PM	No	No I know. Sorry. I was just wondering because Anna said she would invite some guys but I don't think I'll get back in time anyway
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 11:29 PM	Yes	In the unlikely event that I am invited, I couldn't go anyways, I have my Stanford update and cona app to write, but if you want to go please do, I would honestly be upset if you didn't go to a party just because I couldn't make it, you don't have a whole lot of time left in high school and you deserve to enjoy it
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 11:30 PM	No	I appreciate that. But I have to be at school at 930 the next morning anyway 
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 11:44 PM	Yes	Okay, I just want you to know that I am fine with you going, I am about to fall asleep, good night, love you
+13366719609	Feb 27, 2014, 11:49 PM	No	Thanks :) love you too
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 10:21 AM	No	Don't call me whiny...
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:45 AM	Yes	No, I'm going to keep doing it because it bothers you :)
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 12:59 PM	No	You're such an 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 1:30 PM	Yes	Where are you?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 1:35 PM	No	Ummm on the bus 
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 1:37 PM	No	you niss me I'm sure 
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 1:37 PM	No	Miss 
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 3:22 PM	No	I appreciate the care and concern 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 4:42 PM	Yes	Hey I hope that you didn't actually send that text from the bus, you aren't aloud to do that
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 5:13 PM	Yes	And for the record I do miss you
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 6:12 PM	No	Im glad we get alog so well. Really 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 6:43 PM	Yes	:) how's the game going/how'd it go?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 6:45 PM	No	We won!!
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 6:47 PM	No	How're you?
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 7:05 PM	Yes	Awesome, congrats! I am good, ended up going to the gym for the first time in forever
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	Thanks! Congrats to you too:) 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 7:32 PM	Yes	Welcome, and haha, on a different note I got invited to Carolina scholarship day
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 7:33 PM	Yes	Quick question, are you going to the Josie thing tonight?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 7:35 PM	No	That's awesome!!! If I get home at a reasonable time. Are you going?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 7:51 PM	No	You're making me nervous 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 7:53 PM	Yes	Sorry I just got distracted, if you want me to, not crazy about it though because I wasn't actually invited and I'm not sure that many of my friends were either
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	No you're fine. I'm just bored on the bus.  If you don't want me to I won't. We just passed lake Norman. 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 7:56 PM	Yes	I'd rather you do, like I said I don't want you feeling like you can't go out without me, I trust you
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 7:55 PM	No	Okay. But I'm tired so I don't know if I will. And I have to be at school first thing so I don't know if I can drink or anything
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 7:58 PM	Yes	It's your call, it would certainly be nice if you had some energy left tomorrow night, but if we just eat and cuddle that's fine to
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 7:58 PM	No	Hahahaha no no energy tomorrow night after your whiny comment 
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	So pretty much you're rubbing my back the whole night 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:03 PM	Yes	Okay, I'm down to pretend as well
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	I'm not pretending 
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	Also I like scrambled eggs with cheese 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:09 PM	Yes	You like that at night? Or are you implicating that we will be spending the night together soon and I need to know what to make you for breakfast?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	Both I think actually
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Good luck getting my dad to okay that though 
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:21 PM	No	My mom says thank you for helping. That was really nice of you 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:24 PM	Yes	We really didn't do all that much and she tipped us very well, and I am not sure that there is anything that I could possibly say to persuade your dad that spending the night with me is a good idea, although I very much like the idea of that :) and would love if you could figure out a way to make that happen
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:30 PM	No	SHE PAID YOU?! and is itsupposed to snow this week?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	How do I make that happen?
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:34 PM	Yes	Yes, I tried not to take it, and no, and don't tell her I told you, and I have absolutely no idea, I'm not sure I could even get my parents to go for it, but I would really like for that to happen
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	Oh it's okay. Okay well you start brainstorming 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:37 PM	Yes	I say we team effort brainstorm it
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:37 PM	No	Okay throw out the first idea, since you're the ring leader 
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:37 PM	No	Or you can come over later and we can talk about it while you rub my back?? 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:45 PM	Yes	No can do, if we hang out tonight you will go to bed way too late and you have to get up early tomorrow, besides I want to keep you waiting
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:45 PM	No	Keep me waiting for a back rub?
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:49 PM	Yes	No, keep you waiting for me
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:50 PM	No	I really just want you so you can rub my back 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:53 PM	Yes	Ouch
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:53 PM	No	
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 8:53 PM	No	And to do my calc but that's a side job
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:01 PM	Yes	Now you are just making me feel used, definitely making you wait until tomorrow now
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	I'm asking so nicely. You don't want to see me in my sexy uniform?
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:05 PM	Yes	I do, but I am making you wait until tomorrow
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 9:05 PM	No	Connor I just want to lay on top of you is all
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:08 PM	Yes	Not going to work, good try though
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:15 PM	Yes	I believe that you are being honest, but I want you to go to that party, tomorrow night is us time and tonight is you time, besides I have a lot of work I need to get done and though I would like to pretend otherwise I am way too distracted when I'm with you to get anything done
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	Yeah I don't think I'm going to go 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:29 PM	Yes	Are you upset that I won't come over tonight?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 9:35 PM	No	Nope! 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:35 PM	Yes	Are you lying?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 9:36 PM	No	Nope! :(
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 9:36 PM	No	:) oops 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:53 PM	Yes	Good, are you mad at me?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 9:52 PM	No	Nope
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 10:07 PM	No	Alright bro 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 10:16 PM	Yes	I'm not your bro
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 10:16 PM	Yes	That'd be weird
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	I'm about to start treating you like one 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 10:22 PM	Yes	Don't do that, I much prefer being treated like a boyfriend
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 10:24 PM	No	Clearly not!
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 10:41 PM	Yes	That's just not true, I want to be with you but I needed to finish my update and cona app tonight, and I just finished them now
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 10:49 PM	Yes	
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 10:54 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 10:58 PM	Yes	Too much?
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:04 PM	Yes	That's probably for the best, I'm sure you'll figure it out eventually
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 11:05 PM	No	It actually means something?
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:09 PM	Yes	Nah
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 11:10 PM	No	No?
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:15 PM	Yes	Not really
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 11:16 PM	No	Interesting 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:22 PM	Yes	Yeah I don't think you are going to figure it out though
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 11:22 PM	No	I'm sure it's something inappropriate 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:42 PM	Yes	Maybe a little
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 11:45 PM	No	Maybe just tell me
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:51 PM	Yes	That's no fun
+13366719609	Feb 28, 2014, 11:52 PM	No	connnnnorrrrr 
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:57 PM	Yes	Haaannnnaaaahhhhh

+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 12:07 AM	Yes	Your whining is cute, I'm not going to tell you
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 12:10 AM	No	"No apparently it's ""annoying"". Why not? "
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 12:17 AM	Yes	Nah it's cute, and because it's bothering you 
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 12:21 AM	No	You're pushing every button today and I may kill you 
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 12:26 AM	No	Sweet brah. I think I have to go to bed
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 12:30 AM	Yes	Haha okay, good night Hannah, I love you

+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 12:30 AM	No	Yeah maybe 
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 12:30 AM	No	your date night may be a solo one 
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 12:35 AM	Yes	I really hope you don't mean that
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 12:34 AM	No	
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 12:34 AM	No	Maybe if you tell me how spectacular I am I can forgive you
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 12:38 AM	Yes	You are amazing, you are beautiful, and you are smart, and I cannot wait to take you to dinner tomorrow night, and to rub your back afterwards
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 8:34 AM	No	Much better :)
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 8:35 AM	No	I don't know if I can get out of bed 
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 8:54 AM	No	I think we are about to get eaten by some public school girls 
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 10:19 AM	No	Where the hell is Lexington..?
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 11:59 AM	Yes	47 minutes south of Winston Salem, I apologize for taking so long to text back, I was enjoying the fact that I get to sleep in on the weekends
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 1:05 PM	No	Yeah you're alone tonight :)
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 1:44 PM	Yes	Haha how are the scrimmages going?
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 2:19 PM	No	Two down two to go... 
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 2:20 PM	No	But really. You're solo
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 2:44 PM	Yes	I hope you don't mean that, did you win the first two
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 3:28 PM	No	Do I? Yes we won three
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 3:31 PM	Yes	That's awesome! And no, you don't
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 3:30 PM	No	I need an ice hath 
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 3:30 PM	No	Bath
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 4:30 PM	Yes	Ice baths just don't sound like they would be very pleasant, what time are you getting back?
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 5:00 PM	No	No I need one. We just finished and haven't left yet 
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 5:06 PM	No	I don't know if I can move
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 5:11 PM	Yes	Yeah I'd imagine that you are exhausted, did you win the last game?
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 5:11 PM	No	"No and coach is pissed. We ""lost focus"". But everyone is so tired "
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 5:12 PM	Yes	Yeah four games is ridiculous, did everyone else play that many?
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 5:13 PM	No	All the other teams there? Yeah but they didn't have them all back to back like we did. It was like ten minute rest between each one 
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 5:17 PM	Yes	That sounds miserable
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 5:18 PM	No	Yeah I'm not going to argue with that. And you know my coach is an ass but different matter. How're you?
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 5:24 PM	Yes	I'm alright, I'll be much better after I pick you up for dinner tonight
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 5:25 PM	No	I need to get home shower and look decent. Oh man
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 5:30 PM	Yes	Does 730 work then?
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 5:51 PM	No	Sure! 
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 5:54 PM	Yes	Sure as in yes, or sure as in you are mad at me about something?
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 5:57 PM	No	Haha sure as in yes 
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 5:59 PM	Yes	Good :)
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 6:00 PM	No	I almost feel drunk. I'm just warning you
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 6:06 PM	No	What's for dinner?
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 6:07 PM	Yes	Not sure yet, are you feeling anything in particular?
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 6:06 PM	No	Ummm baked ziti....? 
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 6:06 PM	No	But I don't really care
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 6:14 PM	Yes	Unfortunately I can't make that happen tonight, unless there is a specific restaurant that serves a good baked ziti?
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 6:15 PM	No	Ciciones but it really doesn't matter at all
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 6:16 PM	No	Really whatever you want. You're the one dealing with me tonight
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 6:21 PM	Yes	Ciciones it is then, and haha dealing is not the word I would use
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	Is that okay with you? Oh I would. I'm stopping by the store for some snack wells and then I'll be home 
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 6:30 PM	Yes	It is, and what are snack wells? Also does 730 give you enough time or do you want me to pick you up later?
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 6:32 PM	No	No you're fine! You can come whenever now. My parents aren't home so you're fine
+17344782101	Mar 1, 2014, 6:40 PM	Yes	Okay, I am heading over in about 15 minutes
+13366719609	Mar 1, 2014, 6:40 PM	No	Okay

+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 4:17 PM	No	That's good! What did you do? No thank goodness. I've been on the couch all day 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 4:33 PM	Yes	I went for a run and just sat out there, it was nice, and good I'm glad you had a chance to take a break
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 4:39 PM	No	That's good! Yeah it's been nice 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 5:03 PM	Yes	Is your brother going to the yag dinner tonight?
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 5:34 PM	No	I'm not sure! Why?
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 5:58 PM	No	I'm glad you asked. He totally forgot 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 5:59 PM	Yes	That's kinda why I asked actually
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 6:00 PM	No	Yeah he's getting dressed now...
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 6:21 PM	No	Thank you for reminding us!
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 6:23 PM	Yes	No problem, didn't want him to miss out
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	Yeah he was a little upset when I was taking him but he'll get over it
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 7:05 PM	Yes	Haha why was he upset?
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 7:14 PM	No	I called him out...
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 8:27 PM	Yes	Was he trying to not come?
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 8:27 PM	No	No no it was just a dumb argument 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 8:40 PM	Yes	About what?
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 8:40 PM	No	It was so dumb 
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 8:41 PM	No	How was dinner?

+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	Connor it was so silly not worth explaining 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	Haha I want you to explain it though
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	No just because you're so stubborn 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 9:18 PM	Yes	Pretty please with an apple on top
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	Cute but no

+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 9:30 PM	Yes	I hope not, we might have to leave the math competition early, and I would feel bad, but you won't tell me what the argument is about
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	IT WAS ABOUT BACKING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 9:46 PM	Yes	That's not that ridiculous
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	Seriously we need to get out early tomorrow 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 9:57 PM	Yes	No, I'm not going to school anyway so we don't 
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	Yes because the world revolves around Connor. I forgot 
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:00 PM	No	I apologize for forgetting your highness 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 10:07 PM	Yes	Apology accepted, please don't make that mistake again
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:07 PM	No	You're unbelievable

+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 10:17 PM	Yes	I did, does that bother you? Also I was trying to gauge your relationship with your brother
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	Way to ignore my first question 
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	Na. Not at all. I just need to tell Sarah but I don't know how. How were you gauging that?
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 10:20 PM	Yes	I'm not ignoring it, I just haven't decided yet, and by saying that at that table and seeing if it came up in conversation later
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 10:35 PM	Yes	Haha I do now, of course I didn't talk to him much on the yag trip
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	Doesn't mean I didn't get a play by okay, silly
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 10:42 PM	Yes	So you're saying you have him spying on me then?
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	Ha no 
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	I shouldn't have taken a nap so late 
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	Oh I forgot I'm not talking to you 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 10:54 PM	Yes	You need to go back to forgetting that, and yeah you are probably going to be up for a while then
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	You're so mean 
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:56 PM	No	But I love you so I'm clearly blind to your meanness 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 10:58 PM	Yes	You just know that I love you and that makes it tolerable
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	Yeah that's probably it actually 
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 11:00 PM	No	I'm a sucker for people who like me I guess.... 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 11:11 PM	Yes	I like you
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	Have we been dating long enough to have sex? 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 11:20 PM	Yes	There isn't a hard timeline for that actually, in college you may sleep with a guy the night you meet him, in this context waiting longer than that is probably a good idea
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 11:21 PM	No	Yeah that statement makes me feel so much better...
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 11:30 PM	Yes	It's not suppose to, I'm just being honest
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	Not your job sometimes 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 11:35 PM	Yes	It's always my job to be honest with you
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 11:35 PM	No	Yeah but you reminding me this has an expiration date and implying I'll be slutting around in college doesn't make me feel awesome
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 11:44 PM	Yes	I'm sorry, I didn't consider all of the implications of my statement, I was just trying to help you make informed decisions
+13366719609	Mar 2, 2014, 11:47 PM	No	Okay 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 12:05 AM	Yes	Are you upset?
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 12:05 AM	No	I'm not sure 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 12:08 AM	Yes	Please don't be
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 12:07 AM	No	why wouldn't I be?
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 12:12 AM	Yes	Because it won't make it better
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 12:11 AM	No	Won't make what better?
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 12:14 AM	Yes	How you feel about my comment
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 12:15 AM	No	You're saying your comment is the truth?
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 12:16 AM	Yes	No, but a likely outcome
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 12:18 AM	No	Alrighty 
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 12:20 AM	No	As much as I enjoy this conversation with you implying a lot...I'm going to bed 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 12:25 AM	Yes	Good night Hannah, don't think too much, I love you
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 12:25 AM	No	Yeah yeah love you too. Good luck tomorrow, nerd 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 12:29 AM	Yes	Thanks
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 12:39 AM	No	No prob bob
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 1:22 PM	No	Why do you talk to me I'm am idiot
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 1:29 PM	Yes	And I'm confused?
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 1:30 PM	No	I'm fat and ugly
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 1:46 PM	Yes	No you're not, and we aren't having a Hannah pity party about something that isn't true
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 1:47 PM	No	That was Jacob....
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 1:53 PM	No	But if a pity party will get me more attention it's worth a shot
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 1:55 PM	Yes	I thought it might be him, but figured assuming it wasn't was the safer play, and I had every intention of going to lunch with you and when I got back you were already gone
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	I guess that's smart. I know I'm sorry. Well I didn't know but. I had to go to the new house because my grandparents were there and had to see them before they left but you're more than welcome to come over......
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 2:01 PM	Yes	I would like to do that, but I have a lot of work that I procrastinated on and my family is having dinner for my brothers birthday tonight and it's pretty early
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	Okay Connor!
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 5:34 PM	No	Alright brah. I hope you have a good night!
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 8:32 PM	No	
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:40 PM	Yes	I'll take a look
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	I am so mad at you right now
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:49 PM	Yes	I'm aware, I haven't been texting you because I don't know how to deal with or fix it
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	Yeah there's another issue 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:49 PM	Yes	I figured that might be the case, pertaining to?
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	Connor you fucking know. Don't even 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:51 PM	Yes	Daniel?
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 8:53 PM	No	Glad you're making me a priority 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 9:01 PM	Yes	I apologize I have no idea how to answer that question, and you are a priority Hannah, though I recognize that that very clearly means something different to both of us
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	I'm sorry. I'm very mad right now 
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	I know you try to make me a priority. 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	Is all of that anger directed at me?
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 9:07 PM	No	Not to sound bitchy but who else would it be directed at?
+13366719609	Mar 3, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	I suggest you call me if you can somehow find the time
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 9:47 AM	No	
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 9:50 AM	Yes	The redhead in a pink shirt raising her hand?
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 9:51 AM	No	Oh wow my boyfriend is being just as mean as he was 12 hours ago!
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 9:58 AM	Yes	Not mean, just sarcastic, are you still instituting a no lunch policy today?
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:00 AM	Yes	Because I would really like to go to lunch with you
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:03 AM	No	Hmm 
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:04 AM	No	Well I was supposed to go with some of the girls on my team but I told them I might have other plans 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:09 AM	Yes	It's up to you, I have a meeting at 1 for my internship, we could meet somewhere around 1130?
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:10 AM	No	Whatever you want!
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:12 AM	Yes	I want to see you
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:13 AM	No	I can ask my mom if I can drive? I'm not sure 
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:13 AM	No	And I don't want to reach your quota
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:17 AM	Yes	Let me know what she says, also please don't blow off your team if it's not something that you want to do
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:21 AM	No	Would you rather do something after your meeting?
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:23 AM	Yes	Before would be better, but we can do after, would you mind if I went to the gym for a bit after my meeting and then meeting up after that?
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:23 AM	No	I only want to do after if it's okay with you. It's just my mom is trying to get some stuff done in the house this morning 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:26 AM	Yes	After is fine, as long as you  are okay with doing around 330 4 ish
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:26 AM	No	Yes if it's okay with you 
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:26 AM	No	We shouldn't play games and I'm sorry for starting one
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:28 AM	Yes	It's fine, unfortunately my meeting just got pushed back an hour so it will probably be closer to 430 5 ish
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:31 AM	No	Okay. I don't have a ton of time today because my mom wants us helping to move all this stuff. So whatever is best for you really. 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:33 AM	Yes	Hannah if you are to busy to hang out today it's fine, I completely understand and won't view you saying no to hanging out today as retaliation or anger or anything other then that you are busy
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:36 AM	No	Okay I'm sorry. How about I just see how today goes and we can see about later this afternoon?
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:38 AM	Yes	That works for me, I love you Hannah
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	I know and I love you too. I'm sorry 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:46 AM	Yes	You don't need to be, text me when you know what the plan is
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:47 AM	No	I will if you take back calling me needy 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:49 AM	Yes	You are not needy
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:49 AM	No	Thank you 
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 11:55 AM	No	Who are you interviewing with?
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 11:58 AM	Yes	It's not an interview, jay jay Eric and I are going to meet with the guy and fill out the paperwork
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 11:58 AM	No	Ohhh where are you interning? 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 11:59 AM	Yes	Inmar
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 12:01 PM	No	Ohhhhhhhh
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 12:01 PM	Yes	Haha yup
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 12:16 PM	No	Well good luck with that!
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 12:21 PM	Yes	Thanks
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 1:35 PM	No	Mhmmm 
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	I think I should be okay to do something! 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 3:07 PM	Yes	Good :) I'll text you when I get home from the gym
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 3:13 PM	No	Okay :)
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 4:43 PM	Yes	Just finished, can I pick you up at six for dinner?
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 4:45 PM	No	Surreeeee
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 5:50 PM	Yes	On my way
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 5:50 PM	Yes	Running a few minutes late
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 6:02 PM	Yes	I'm here
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:46 PM	No	Are you still awake?
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:48 PM	Yes	Yeah, what's up?
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:48 PM	No	I joined the Davidson class of 2018 or whatever Facebook page and I just started freaking out and I don't know why
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 10:56 PM	Yes	Because it feels more real now Hannah, more present, if you don't think about it you will calm down
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 10:57 PM	No	Yeah but what if I made a terrible choice about where I'm going? And everyone is awful? 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 11:00 PM	Yes	College is going to be whatever you make it Hannah, where you end up matters a lot less than you may think
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 11:02 PM	No	Okay thaks
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 11:03 PM	Yes	I love you Hannah 
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 11:04 PM	No	Sorry for bothering you. Love you too 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 11:05 PM	Yes	It's not a bother, you can always come to me when something is upsetting you
+13366719609	Mar 4, 2014, 11:07 PM	No	Thanks bruh 
+13366719609	Mar 5, 2014, 9:52 PM	No	If Daniel says something to me that may be inappropriate am I supposed to tell you?
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:55 PM	Yes	Only if you want too, but probably 
+13366719609	Mar 5, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	It's not inappropriate to me but It may be to you? Probably as inv
+13366719609	Mar 5, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	?
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:59 PM	Yes	Haha just go ahead and say it
+13366719609	Mar 5, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 10:04 PM	Yes	Haha I am fine with people complementing you Hannah
+13366719609	Mar 5, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	You're patronizing stop
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 10:06 PM	Yes	I didn't intend to do that
+13366719609	Mar 5, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	It's fiiine 
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 10:32 PM	Yes	I know you get more than enough of that from perry, how was practice?
+13366719609	Mar 5, 2014, 10:42 PM	No	Yeah. But you're welcome for trying to be a good girlfriend and be nice and consider your feelings and  tell you :) \LFOh it was okay! My old bat was shot so the coach gave me another one. Which was kind of shockingly nice from him 
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 10:44 PM	Yes	And I appreciate it :) and that's good, indicative of a long term change or just an isolated gesture?
+13366719609	Mar 5, 2014, 10:45 PM	No	Yeah yeah. \LFEh well he's sending my old one back and is getting a replacement and just had this one on hand. So I think it was really just convenience. 
+13366719609	Mar 5, 2014, 11:56 PM	No	Please just read this for me
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:43 AM	Yes	Sorry I fell asleep
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:48 AM	No	No you're fine! As long as you aren't mad
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 3:51 PM	No	Are you mad...?
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 3:53 PM	Yes	No
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 3:54 PM	No	What's wrong then...!
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 3:54 PM	No	?
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 3:55 PM	Yes	Nothing, why do you think that something is wrong?
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 3:55 PM	No	You seemed weird today. You promise everything is okay?
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 3:58 PM	Yes	Just tired, and yeah
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	Okayy
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 4:02 PM	Yes	Is y'all's game still on? I saw a bunch of people dressed out
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 4:02 PM	No	No we had to take pictures. We have practice at his thing I'm on my way there
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 4:43 PM	Yes	That indoor place is really killing y'all 
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 5:22 PM	No	You're telling me. He let us out because of the sleet or whatever
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 6:15 PM	Yes	Well that's good, at least he's not completely crazy, I don't think my rents will let me out tonight :(
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	No it's fine! But bummer. You can't spend the night 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 6:38 PM	Yes	That would be really nice, but there is no way it would end well, it's looking like we will have a lot more to time to hang out tomorrow though :)
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 6:43 PM	Yes	By not end well I mean your dad would kill me
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 6:47 PM	No	I really hope we don't have school tomorrow...yeah maybe not. My mom and I had a long and painful conversation about it last night. 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 6:57 PM	Yes	That would be fantastic, and how did that conversation go?
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	Yeah it was uncomfortable 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:01 PM	Yes	What was it about?
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	Yeah we don't need to talk about it...
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:09 PM	Yes	Maybe, but I think that I know what it is and would like to
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	Then if you know what it is we're good! :)
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:11 PM	Yes	I think, and believe it or not I recognize that I am fallable
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:12 PM	No	Just a good old conversation about sex
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:17 PM	Yes	Maybe I'm not fallable, is she afraid that you would sleep with me tomorrow night to make sure I wouldn't do anything in the dr?
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:19 PM	No	Oh no. She just wants to make sure I have the birth control stuff situated and that I'm not rushing in to anything and explained I'm probably going to want to get it back later in life... So
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:29 PM	Yes	Sounds like a ton of fun, and I apologize for my previous assumption, I realized just now that I misread an earlier text
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	Oh yeah I loved every minute of it. No it's fine. But speaking of the dr do you know what Anna said to me?
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:32 PM	Yes	No, what did she say?
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:33 PM	No	"She kept harassing me and asking if we were dating and then said ""don't worry I'll keep an eye on him in the dr. But if he does do anything I'll take pictures"""
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:39 PM	Yes	That is quite awkward
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	No like who the hell says that
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:41 PM	Yes	People like Anna French 
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	Ugh 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 7:57 PM	Yes	I like how she implies that she'll be involved enough to take pictures, it's really a nice touch
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	Yeah she doesn't need to be keeping an eye on you. She'd be all over you 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 8:02 PM	Yes	Yeah I wouldn't let that happen
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	Yeah but you're going to be very drunk so 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 8:06 PM	Yes	That's true
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	Awesome
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 8:07 PM	Yes	Sorry, that probably didn't make you feel great
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:07 PM	No	Yep!
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 8:09 PM	Yes	That's unfortunate, I just want to make sure we are both on the same page
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:09 PM	No	That you'll cheat on me?
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 8:11 PM	Yes	That though I don't intend to, it is a possibility
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Uhuh...
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 8:14 PM	Yes	How do you feel about it? Brutal honesty please
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	Feel about what?
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 8:18 PM	Yes	That is fairly obvious 
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	I would be extremely hurt. And I appreciate you being honest but you're being offensive
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	If you really love someone you wouldn't want to throw it all away for a few drunken days 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 8:34 PM	Yes	You are right
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	So you don't really love me?
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	11 start 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:37 PM	Yes	It will be canceled in the morning just like Tuesday 
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	I'm just warning you that if you decide this is what you want you may have to stay fighting for it 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:48 PM	Yes	I know, I'll see you tomorrow
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	You know as in...?
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 9:52 PM	No	Sweet if you're going to end it lets do it now
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:55 PM	Yes	I know as in I know, and I'm not ending it
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:57 PM	Yes	Look I told you I would occasionally have these moods, I am not going to breakup with you every time they come up, because I genuinely believe that I want to be with you and that I love you, I have just never been in a similar situation and I don't know how to handle it, I will see you tomorrow
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	Yeah yeah if I get out of bed
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:09 PM	Yes	Good :)
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 10:09 PM	No	I mean I'll see you at school 
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	I don't think you understand how mentally exhausted I am. 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:14 PM	Yes	You are probably right, and school will be canceled Hannah, so meeting outside of school would be better
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 10:15 PM	No	No we are going to have to go and I'm going to fail everything 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:19 PM	Yes	Be more positive, we won't have to go, but even if we do, you will pass everything with flying colors
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	This whole thing is comical 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:23 PM	Yes	Yeah...
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	I actually am trying to believe that you're not going to break up with me. It's funny I believe that 
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 10:24 PM	No	And there should be a bunch of red flags in my head that this argument is happening before the dr
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:28 PM	Yes	Yes, there should, and no it's not really funny, because I'm not going to end it, I want to stay together Hannah, because I care about you, I have made abundantly clear the potential downsides of staying with me, because I want you to make an informed decision
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:29 PM	Yes	I recognize that your judgement is likely clouded by emotion, but you have all the facts, if you want to stay with me, which I want you to do, you are making that choice knowing everything that might go wrong
+13366719609	Mar 6, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	I don't even 
+13366719609	Mar 7, 2014, 3:24 PM	No	Are you still in a mood?
+13366719609	Mar 7, 2014, 4:17 PM	No	I'll take that as a yes
+13366719609	Mar 7, 2014, 4:53 PM	No	I'm sorry but I kind of need to know if we have plans tonigt
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 4:56 PM	Yes	I'm not, sorry I was lifting, and yes I would like to have plans tonight if that works for you
+13366719609	Mar 7, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	Are you sure you aren't?
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 5:08 PM	Yes	Yes, pick you up at 7?
+13366719609	Mar 7, 2014, 5:16 PM	No	Yeah I'm at the mall. I should be done by ten 
+13366719609	Mar 7, 2014, 5:16 PM	No	Then 
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 5:19 PM	Yes	Okay :) let me know
+13366719609	Mar 7, 2014, 5:47 PM	No	Yeah it should be good
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 6:44 PM	Yes	I am on my way
+13366719609	Mar 7, 2014, 6:47 PM	No	Ok
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 6:59 PM	Yes	I'm here
+13366719609	May 11, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	Hey.  Can I ask you something?
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 8:44 PM	Yes	Of course
+13366719609	May 11, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	I just need to make sure you didn't have an std or infection when we were together
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 8:46 PM	Yes	As far as I am aware I did not
+13366719609	May 11, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	Do you have something now?
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 8:47 PM	Yes	Not that I am aware of, no symptoms, but have not been tested recently
+13366719609	May 11, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	Ok thanks
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 8:49 PM	Yes	Do I need to go get tested?
+13366719609	May 11, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	I don't think so
+13366719609	Sep 8, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	I'm pretty sure you started me on a downward spiral with guys...
+17344782101	Sep 8, 2014, 11:21 PM	Yes	Or maybe it's just all downhill from me?
+13366719609	Sep 8, 2014, 11:55 PM	No	You wish. Ironically enough this ones name was Konner 
+13366719609	Sep 8, 2014, 11:57 PM	No	Shoulda known 
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 12:07 AM	Yes	That is ironic, on a serious note sorry that things aren't going well for you in that area
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 12:09 AM	No	Eh it's fine. You found the one yet?
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 12:28 AM	No	I'm sorry. I texted you out of reaction. 
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 12:41 AM	Yes	It's fine, and surprisingly I do have a gf already
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 12:41 AM	No	Oh damn I'm impressed
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 1:09 AM	Yes	I actually met her at the beginning of the summer at an admit weekend
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 8:35 AM	No	Good for you! That's great 
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 9:45 AM	Yes	Haha so much sarcasm, how's college been for ya?
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 10:36 AM	No	I'm not being sarcastic! It's great. I love it. How about you? 
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 6:15 PM	Yes	It's a lot more work than I anticipated, but other than that it's pretty nice, so what happened with this konner kid?
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 6:32 PM	No	Yeah same. Oh long story short...the ex girlfriend is here tonight. 
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 6:41 PM	No	Apparently the ex girlfriend fucked a best friend so obviously she has to come so they can talk about it...
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 8:41 PM	Yes	That's dumb, tell him no
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	Yeah well I think she's here. And we weren't really at the me telling him what to do stage. 
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 9:20 PM	Yes	Haha maybe not directly, but you do realize you could have just said you were out if he let her come up? Then you even get the added bonus of knowing where ya stand, also relationships in college are a bad idea
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 9:23 PM	No	So says the guy already with a girlfriend...yeah yeah I realize that. What happened to us? Were you just trying to get in my pants? 
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 9:23 PM	No	Ps I'm not drunk. That was super blunt sorry
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 9:35 PM	Yes	Haha it's fine, and no, I just have a tendency to talk myself into relationships when it probably isn't what I really want
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 9:37 PM	No	Hmmm okay fair enough
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 9:45 PM	Yes	Yeah if you recall correctly I broke it off so that we wouldn't do anything to serious
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 9:46 PM	No	Oh is that why? Hahaha that was all really screwed up we don't need to get into it
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 10:02 PM	Yes	Haha just started drinking so definitely not a good idea
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	Yeah? 
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 10:18 PM	Yes	Yeah
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	You gonna share your undying love for me? 
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 10:20 PM	Yes	No, I'll probably stay pretty coherent
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	Damn
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 10:22 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, trying no to get to trashed
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 10:25 PM	No	That's good!!! Really proud. You've come a long way
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 10:39 PM	Yes	Haha we'll see, it's still pretty early
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	True true. 
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	Ok so advice for when I see Konner in the morning
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 11:16 PM	Yes	Honestly, my advice is move on and don't see him, it's college, it's time to fuck around
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 11:19 PM	No	Solid advice 
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 11:30 PM	Yes	Your turn, my gf wanted to meet up to fuck, but she just ran into me and I'm pretty drunk and walked away, what do I do?
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 11:31 PM	No	Oh shit. Did you say anything? Or just walk away?
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 11:31 PM	No	I missed these blatant conversations 
+17344782101	Sep 9, 2014, 11:46 PM	Yes	I did, but it was coherent, and haha really?
+13366719609	Sep 9, 2014, 11:47 PM	No	"As I recall...someone told me once that ""you do what you want when you're drunk"". Fo you want to patch it up? \LFAnd do I miss someone telling me about their raunchy night life? No"
+17344782101	Sep 10, 2014, 12:00 AM	Yes	Was that me? And haha I'm not really sure what that means? And yeah I'd imagine you wouldn't, so what you decide about konner?
+13366719609	Sep 10, 2014, 12:03 AM	No	Yes that was you. I meant do you want to make up with your girlfriend tonight? And I don't know. It doesn't matter I guess. He's a wrestler though so...I have a weakness for the big chest and arms. 
+13369715457	Jan 28, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	Hey do you have any idea what were doing for formal? 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:09 PM	Yes	Not sure yet, there is some talk of a group going to milners, do you have any preference as to who we hang out with?
+13369715457	Jan 28, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	Yeah that's fine. I've been talking to Hannah and we'd like to stick together with Maddie and Josie if that works and whoever else but she doesn't want to be with alex at all haha 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:41 PM	Yes	Haha of course, well we'll figure it out eventually, so right now all that I know about you is that you hate Forsyth and that you go hard at wake every weekend, I feel like I have an incomplete picture
+13369715457	Jan 28, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	Yeah we've never really talked! I haven't been to wake in a while my parents have been super strict since mclains whole thing. And school is much better this year I've tried to be more social with Forsyth people haha 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 10:55 PM	Yes	Haha so it turns out I actually knew nothing then, who is mclain?
+13369715457	Jan 28, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	Oh sorry I guess you wouldn't know he's my older brother. In October he got really hammered at his fraternity retreat and fell off a balcony and had a bad brain injury and had to withdraw from school. He's fine now but my mom doesn't really trust us as much as she used to for obvious reasons 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:13 PM	Yes	That's awful, I'm sorry to hear that
+13369715457	Jan 28, 2014, 11:19 PM	No	No it's fine and he's back at school and everything but my mom now knows what goes on at college parties haha. What do I need to know about you? 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:33 PM	Yes	That's good, and what would you like to know? We're still not done with you yet by the way
+13369715457	Jan 28, 2014, 11:46 PM	No	Ugh this is difficult. All I know is you moved here from somewhere up north you're really smart and apparently you had a rough night after snowball haha 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:05 AM	Yes	Haha two of those things are true, moved down from MI, and was quite hungover this weekend/Monday. You decided not to go to snowball?
+13369715457	Jan 29, 2014, 12:11 AM	No	No I wanted to go but I was in Nashville all weekend. I got to hear all about it though! 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:40 AM	Yes	Right, I remember someone saying something about that the other day, so back to you, what else should I know? What do you do for fun? Favorite restaurant, etc.?
+13369715457	Jan 29, 2014, 12:58 AM	No	Hmm I play piano, I love traveling and just getting out of the house and going somewhere, shopping and girl time with my friends. I'm really not picky about food but I like sushi at mizu and lots of the cute downtown places! I'm celiac though so I can't eat wheat/gluten so that kind of limits things haha. What about you?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:14 PM	Yes	How long have you been playing? And sorry to hear about the celiacs, I know that is a huge pain, I like to do a lot of things including guitar and piano and am not particularly good at any of them, I like downtown stuff too but am use to Ann Arbor and Winston just does not compare, I enjoy shopping and I'm not a fan of girl time, my perspective on that may however be temporarily skewed by the lack of intelligence in my entirely female study hall, please don't tell any of them I said that
+13369715457	Jan 29, 2014, 12:52 PM	No	I've been playing the piano forever but I'm not very good I definitely didn't get my moms musical genes. ouch I actually like winston... It's pretty cute and the perfect size but I'm sure Ann Arbor is great. Charlotte is actually my favorite though. I don't know who is in your study hall but I know what you mean haha 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 1:52 PM	Yes	I'm sure you are pretty good, what does your mom play? And I guess Winston's okay, haven't been to Charlotte too many times, and haha yeah
+13369715457	Jan 29, 2014, 2:03 PM	No	She's an organist. No think about it winston is the best we got half an inch of snow and we will get two days off of school! I bet that doesn't happen in michigan 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 6:42 PM	Yes	I've never met an organist. I'm excited. And haha I'm not sure that makes Winston great but I'm certainly not complaining, and actually they did, sometimes it got so cold they called school with no snow, what color is your dress again?
+13369715457	Jan 29, 2014, 6:59 PM	No	It's black and grayish silver if that helps 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 7:00 PM	Yes	In that case what color corsage do you want?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 7:00 PM	Yes	Apparently black is pretty neutral, so it's up to you
+13369715457	Jan 29, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	Pink! 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 7:34 PM	Yes	Pink it is then
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	Are you good with fratellis before formal?
+13369715457	Jan 29, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	Yes that's fine! Did y'all make reservations?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:26 PM	Yes	We're going to very soon
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 9:26 PM	Yes	I think
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 1:03 AM	Yes	Eric wants to know if your parents would like to, with his and any of the other parents that would like to go, to go to dinner tomorrow night while we are at formal
+13369715457	Feb 1, 2014, 1:06 AM	No	Oh cool I'll talk to them and let him know tomorrow 
+13369715457	Feb 1, 2014, 11:31 AM	No	Do you know what time you're picking me up?
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 1:00 PM	Yes	710ish, what is your address?
+13369715457	Feb 1, 2014, 1:05 PM	No	Ok it's 890 buttonwood dr winston 27104
+13369715457	Feb 1, 2014, 6:18 PM	No	Hey have you talked to Sam? Hannah hasn't heard if he's picking her up or not yet 
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 6:18 PM	Yes	I haven't, I'm assuming that means he is
+13369715457	Feb 1, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	Ok she just doesn't know what to do they haven't talked all day
+17344782101	Feb 1, 2014, 7:01 PM	Yes	Running a few minutes late
+13369715457	Feb 1, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	Ok that's fine! 
+13369715457	Feb 3, 2014, 9:30 PM	No	I felt like it was awkward when we saw each other today and I don't want it to be. I promise I'm not mad at you or anything! 
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:54 PM	Yes	I'm really glad to hear that you are not mad, I made a complete fool of myself on Saturday and I still feel terrible about it
+13369715457	Feb 3, 2014, 10:00 PM	No	No it's really okay it was kind of a funny situation if you think about it. I just wanted to make sure we're good 
+13369715457	Mar 27, 2014, 8:25 PM	No	Hey did you hear from penn? 
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:31 PM	Yes	I did, I got into wharton
+13369715457	Mar 27, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	Yay I thought you would! Sorry I just love hearing where people get in 
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:49 PM	Yes	Thanks! And haha I completely understand, I do too, congrats again on rice!
+13369715457	Mar 27, 2014, 9:04 PM	No	Thanks! but I kind of wish I applied to more schools I'm feeling left out of the excitement haha 
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:06 PM	Yes	Haha if it makes you feel any better I think most of us would replace the word excitement with pain stress and disappointment
+13369715457	Mar 27, 2014, 9:11 PM	No	Haha true... I have a friend who was rejected from 5 schools today I can't imagine how awful that would be 
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:17 PM	Yes	It sucks, only one rejection, but three wait lists, just all very disappointing
+13369715457	Mar 27, 2014, 9:23 PM	No	But you got into Wharton! So you know you're going to a great school even if the others don't work our
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:30 PM	Yes	I know, I'm definitely thrilled about wharton, it's just that my dad is on the board there and even though my wait lists indicate otherwise I feel like I didn't completely earn it
+13369715457	Mar 27, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	You can't think about it like that they obviously thought you were qualified enough to admit you! All this college stuff just messes with your mind 
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:45 PM	Yes	It really does, I'm glad it's almost over
+13369715457	Mar 27, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	Two months til graduation!!!

+17344782101	Apr 3, 2014, 4:46 PM	Yes	Could you send me a picture of your dress?
+13369715457	Apr 3, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	
+17344782101	Apr 3, 2014, 4:59 PM	Yes	Thanks
+17344782101	Apr 3, 2014, 5:56 PM	Yes	What would you like to do before prom?
+13369715457	Apr 3, 2014, 6:54 PM	No	It really doesn't matter to me having dinner at prom makes the before plans kind of difficult 
+13369715457	Apr 5, 2014, 8:39 PM	No	Hey what are doing tonight? 
+17344782101	Apr 5, 2014, 8:46 PM	Yes	I went down to Charlotte last night so I told my parents I'd stay in tonight, why?
+13369715457	Apr 5, 2014, 8:51 PM	No	Oh yeah did you go to barstool? Were trying to have something at yasmines apartment tonight 
+17344782101	Apr 5, 2014, 9:01 PM	Yes	I did, and I would come but I already told my brother and sister i'd watch a movie with them, on a related note, I would really like to take you out some time before prom, maybe dinner Wednesday?
+13369715457	Apr 5, 2014, 9:04 PM	No	No it's fine I don't know who else is coming. Yes I'd really like that! 
+17344782101	Apr 5, 2014, 9:18 PM	Yes	:) How's your weekend been?
+13369715457	Apr 5, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	Last night was boring but tonight will be fun! What movie are y'all watching 
+17344782101	Apr 5, 2014, 10:00 PM	Yes	We are still trying to decide, any suggestions?
+13369715457	Apr 5, 2014, 10:04 PM	No	Haha no the last one I watched was the wolf of Wall Street and that's not exactly a family movie 
+17344782101	Apr 5, 2014, 10:36 PM	Yes	Yeah, too much coke and too many hookers, we are having quite a difficult time picking
+17344782101	Apr 9, 2014, 6:42 AM	Yes	Hey, you still good to do something tonight? It's my moms birthday so I can't do dinner, but coffee after?

+13369715457	Apr 9, 2014, 6:53 AM	No	Ok sounds good. Are you still at penn?
+17344782101	Apr 9, 2014, 7:02 AM	Yes	Yeah, I'm flying back around noon

+17344782101	Apr 9, 2014, 7:33 AM	Yes	Haha yeah, I'm actually skipping Friday as well for a yag thing, it's been a great week
+17344782101	Apr 9, 2014, 3:55 PM	Yes	Does 730 at the Starbucks on robinhood work for you?
+13369715457	Apr 9, 2014, 3:58 PM	No	Yes sounds good!
+17344782101	Apr 9, 2014, 4:09 PM	Yes	Good :)
+17344782101	Apr 9, 2014, 7:28 PM	Yes	I apologize I'm running a few minutes late
+13369715457	Apr 9, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	Haha that's good because I am too I'll be there soon 
+13369715457	Apr 9, 2014, 9:41 PM	No	Thanks for tonight! Sorry I had to leave so soon... Homework unfortunately still exists 
+17344782101	Apr 9, 2014, 9:42 PM	Yes	Haha that's fine, I totally understand, I'm really glad we got to do this
+13369715457	Apr 9, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	Yeah it was nice to talk. Nesbit decided to give us a practice exam for a test grade so I'm trying to read the crash book 
+17344782101	Apr 9, 2014, 10:27 PM	Yes	Nesbit is great, haha atleast you will be way over prepared
+13369715457	Apr 12, 2014, 12:12 PM	No	Hey do you know what time you're picking me up tonight? 
+17344782101	Apr 12, 2014, 12:14 PM	Yes	Do you know what time it starts?
+13369715457	Apr 12, 2014, 12:19 PM	No	Dinner starts at 6 
+17344782101	Apr 12, 2014, 12:23 PM	Yes	Does 530 work then? That would give your parents some time for pictures and we could still get to the buffet fairly early
+13369715457	Apr 12, 2014, 12:27 PM	No	Yes that sounds good
+17344782101	Apr 12, 2014, 5:14 PM	Yes	What's your address?
+13369715457	Apr 12, 2014, 5:15 PM	No	890 buttonwood dr winston 27104
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 2:56 PM	Yes	You forgot to sign my yearbook :( also I meant what I said about getting to know each other
+13369715457	May 2, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	Please don't talk through Sam he doesn't deserve to be in the middle and I hate that he knows about this 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 9:33 PM	Yes	Believe me I would much rather talk directly to you, can we meet up tomorrow? Also I want you to know that I didn't tell him
+13369715457	May 2, 2014, 9:45 PM	No	Maybe id kind of rather just forget about this. I don't know who told him but they really shouldn't have
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 9:58 PM	Yes	I get that, but talking will make that easier and better, just avoiding things really doesn't work
+13369715457	May 2, 2014, 10:19 PM	No	No you're right we probably should talk 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 10:46 PM	Yes	When are you free tomorrow?
+13369715457	May 3, 2014, 11:25 AM	No	I guess this afternoon? 
+17344782101	May 3, 2014, 11:47 AM	Yes	4 at Starbucks on robinhood?
+13369715457	May 3, 2014, 12:17 PM	No	Ok 
+17344782101	May 3, 2014, 3:54 PM	Yes	I'm here
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 8:39 PM	Yes	We made a mistake Corinne, and I thought we both agreed to forget it happened and just move on, getting me uninvited to things isn't moving on, if it's because your mad that's fine, I get it, but if it's because your worried something might happen, it wouldn't, I respect your position and will stay away
+13369715457	May 9, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	I didn't get you uninvited I didn't say anything about you not coming. Yas decided who she wanted to be there 
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 8:45 PM	Yes	
+13369715457	May 9, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	I haven't talked to Evan so I don't know what that's about 
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 8:54 PM	Yes	Haha you don't have to talk to Evan, say anything to any of those girls and he'll no in a couple of minutes. Look I completely understand why you wouldn't want me there, but if noble is lying then that would be nice to know
+13369715457	May 9, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	I promise I didn't say anything about you yasmine just didn't want you to come I don't know why
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 9:13 PM	Yes	I'm really sorry I bothered you then, thank you for being more mature than I just was
+13364805150	Jan 28, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	Hey
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:37 PM	Yes	Hey, what's up?
+13364805150	Jan 28, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	Do y'all have a snow day tomorrow
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:39 PM	Yes	We do
+13364805150	Jan 28, 2014, 11:39 PM	No	Do you want to go to Starbucks tommorrow 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:46 PM	Yes	Sure, what time were you thinking?
+13364805150	Jan 28, 2014, 11:50 PM	No	Does 1 sound good? 
+17344782101	Jan 28, 2014, 11:59 PM	Yes	I think so, I'm out in lewisville and I kind of need to wait for the roads to get a little better, I was sliding all over earlier even in the hummer
+13364805150	Jan 29, 2014, 12:00 AM	No	Yeah if it's too dangerous we can do it some other time:) especially if you're in lewisville
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:06 AM	Yes	I should be able to make it :)
+13364805150	Jan 29, 2014, 11:19 AM	No	I think we should wait longer than 1 because the ice probably won't be melted, or reschedule for another day
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 11:26 AM	Yes	I was just about to text you actually, I'm fine either way, what do you want to do?
+13364805150	Jan 29, 2014, 11:25 AM	No	Do you want to give it a couple more hours and meet up today? 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 11:29 AM	Yes	If you think that you will be comfortable driving later then I'm happy to do that
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 11:30 AM	Yes	Main roads aren't that bad
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 11:31 AM	Yes	Saw two cars of the rad on shattLon 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 11:32 AM	Yes	And roads by you are likely worse
+13364805150	Jan 29, 2014, 11:55 AM	No	My cars smaller and Starbucks isn't too far away so id be comfortable with it if we waited a little longer. I'll be really slow and cautious lol I just hope you aren't nervous about it. 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:16 PM	Yes	Okay, and nah I'm good, I drive a tank
+13364805150	Jan 29, 2014, 12:44 PM	No	Haha ok see ya there 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:44 PM	Yes	Haha what time? I don't think we earlier finalized that
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:44 PM	Yes	Ever*
+13364805150	Jan 29, 2014, 12:45 PM	No	Um I'm flexible...does 330 work for you
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:46 PM	Yes	Yeah, sounds good
+13364805150	Jan 29, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	Cool see ya later :)
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:46 PM	Yes	:)
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 3:00 PM	Yes	Hey I hate to do this but can we reschedule for this weekend? I am not feeling great and I'm really tired
+13364805150	Jan 29, 2014, 3:01 PM	No	Yeah that's fine
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 3:03 PM	Yes	Are you sure? I really do want to hang out I just had a really long night last night
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 3:04 PM	Yes	One of my friends is a little bit depressed last night was not good for him
+13364805150	Jan 29, 2014, 3:05 PM	No	Aw, I understand. Believe me, I'm fine with it
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 3:17 PM	Yes	Thanks, I'm really sorry
+13364805150	Mar 2, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	Would you still want to hang out with a group? 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 8:30 PM	Yes	I can't, I probably should have told you this a while ago, but the reason I haven't been texting you is because I started dating someone.
+13364805150	Mar 2, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	I understand, I hope you know I just wanted it to be as friends but I'm glad you want to be loyal to her. Is that why you wouldn't go to Starbucks with me that one time? 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 8:53 PM	Yes	No it hadn't started then, but soon after, and I know that you just wanted it to be as friends, but I still don't think she'd be comfortable with it
+13364805150	Mar 2, 2014, 8:54 PM	No	Sometimes I wish it wouldn't be so awkward and complicated between us 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 9:20 PM	Yes	That would be nice, although too be honest I feel like we are in a pretty good place, really the only reason I won't hang out with you is that I don't want my girlfriend to be uncomfortable
+13364805150	Mar 2, 2014, 9:35 PM	No	I know it just kinda hurts but don't worry I'll get over it soon 
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 10:03 PM	Yes	I'm sorry
+17344782101	May 6, 2014, 8:18 PM	Yes	Hey baby
+13364805150	May 6, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	Haha 
+17344782101	May 6, 2014, 8:21 PM	Yes	Haha sorry, that was John
+13364805150	May 20, 2014, 8:32 PM	No	Hey, how've you been? It's been awhile 
+17344782101	May 20, 2014, 11:38 PM	Yes	I've been alright, done with school so that's nice, what about you?
+13364805150	May 21, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	Ah lucky! And I've been pretty good, sorry it took so long to respond to this but I've been busy with a lot of things. Do you have an internship?

+13364805150	May 22, 2014, 9:23 AM	No	Oh cool, where was it at? And I've just been busy with a lot of babysitting and summer trip planning stuff. Are you gonna be at beach week?

+13364805150	May 22, 2014, 10:06 AM	No	Yeah I am and I'm just going to the beach a couple of times. But what I have to plan is basically the beach trip with my group. Also, I was wondering if y'all still go to salem chapel? I just haven't seen you in months 
+17344782101	May 22, 2014, 12:36 PM	Yes	Fun, y'all don't have a house down there for beach week yet? and my family usually goes a couple times a month, but I haven't been in a while
+13364805150	May 22, 2014, 12:52 PM	No	Actually we do, I'm just talking about money and what were bringing in stuff. Well be 5 min from cherry grove. Will you be in town for most of this summer?

+13364805150	May 22, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	Yeah that's fine 
+17344782101	May 22, 2014, 8:50 PM	Yes	Where do you want to meet?
+13364805150	May 22, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Starbucks should be fine 
+17344782101	May 22, 2014, 9:27 PM	Yes	Sounds good :)
+17344782101	May 23, 2014, 7:22 PM	Yes	Turns out I don't have internship stuff tomorrow, and that I have something at 4, is one still good by any chance? Sorry to switch things up on ya
+13364805150	May 23, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	Sure that's fine 
+13364805150	May 24, 2014, 12:39 PM	No	Hey:) are we still good for 1? 
+17344782101	May 24, 2014, 12:39 PM	Yes	Yup :)
+13364805150	May 24, 2014, 12:53 PM	No	Robinhood?

+13364805150	May 24, 2014, 1:05 PM	No	Yeah I'm inside 
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 12:53 PM	Yes	Hey :)
+13364805150	May 26, 2014, 1:18 PM	No	
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 1:28 PM	Yes	Thats okay, I have some internship stuff I have to do anyway, hows your memorial day going?
+13364805150	May 26, 2014, 3:56 PM	No	Going good :) what about yours? 
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 6:35 PM	Yes	That's good, and very productive, just about finished my internship project, what all did ya do?
+13364805150	May 26, 2014, 7:30 PM	No	I bet that's exciting :) and we just drove home from chapel hill and I went to Elizabeth trogdons bday party. What all are you gonna do after you finish your internship? 
+17344782101	May 28, 2014, 4:46 PM	Yes	It is, and fun, and honestly I'm not sure, this week has been very packed with graduation stuff and I haven't had much time to think about it, so what do they have you do at school post ap exams?
+13364805150	May 28, 2014, 6:04 PM	No	"We're not learning anything were just doing ""fun"" projects. The teachers are letting us slack off because they know we've already taken the ap exams and everything. After this week I'll basically be done but I'll have to go to school for an hour or so each day for the first week of June for teacher made exams (which will be easy) "
+17344782101	May 28, 2014, 7:07 PM	Yes	Seems kinda silly, sorry they waste your time like that, do you have any plans for this weekend?
+13364805150	May 28, 2014, 8:09 PM	No	I might be doing some stuff but nothing is definite. What about you? 
+17344782101	May 28, 2014, 8:30 PM	Yes	I've got a lot of family in town, but I was hoping we could hangout? If not this weekend, maybe sometime early next week? Louie really wants to get together and smoke by the way
+13364805150	May 28, 2014, 8:32 PM	No	Remind me, your graduating this weekend right? And haha yeah id like that. Dayna and I were planning on it so that would probably work out for this weekend 
+17344782101	May 28, 2014, 9:51 PM	Yes	"Yeah, ceremony is on Friday, Ive got a lot of family here so I'm not sure I'll be able to go out this weekend yet, but it should be okay, and that would definitely be fun, what are some of your ""fun"" projects?"
+17344782101	May 28, 2014, 9:55 PM	Yes	Also what's dayna's last name? Louie wanted to know
+13364805150	May 29, 2014, 8:54 AM	No	I just have some power points to make in a couple of classes and were making a roller coaster for physics. And her names dayna Creasy 
+13364805150	May 29, 2014, 8:54 AM	No	And if we did hang it would be on Saturday or Sunday 
+13364805150	May 29, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	Would Saturday at 6ish work for y'all? 
+17344782101	May 29, 2014, 4:47 PM	Yes	My little cousin Gigi has her first dance recital then and I would feel pretty bad missing it, sorry this weekends a little busier than I realized, and I'm not sure how long all my family is in town, maybe we do that the following weekend, and just the two of us get together some time during next week? I really do want to hang out this weekend is just really busy
+13364805150	May 29, 2014, 5:58 PM	No	I understand completely, I don't want you to miss her first dance recital. And sounds good :) 
+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 7:24 PM	Yes	How's your weekend going?
+13364805150	May 31, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	It's been good, what about yours? 
+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 10:19 PM	Yes	Pretty good, went to a fun graduation party, and my little cuz was adorable at her recital, do anything interesting?
+13364805150	May 31, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	Yeah, dayna and i went to Reynolda with a bunch of other people today and it was really fun. I went to a really weird club thing last night but I thought it was kinda lame, we almost went to the neon dance but decided not to...and now were just watching boring romantic movies haha 
+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 10:26 PM	Yes	Haha fun, what club? And good call on the neon dance, I think we are definitely to old for those things, and haha which boring romantic movies?
+13364805150	May 31, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	Idk, it was in Greensboro. I was the dd, it was way too creepy it was a lot of sketch people and my friend is crazier than I thought she was. she took pills before and flashed everyone so I left and went to my car to wait for everyone haha but at least today's been better. And right now it's this movie called endless love. So you went to the dance? 
+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 10:58 PM	Yes	That does sound pretty crazy, and god no, john wanted to though, haven't seen that one, is it any good?
+13364805150	May 31, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	Haha it's pretty cheesy actually 
+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 11:36 PM	Yes	Haha with that title I can't say that's terribly surprising
+13364805150	Jun 1, 2014, 4:42 PM	No	Do you wanna hang Wednesday? 
+17344782101	Jun 1, 2014, 4:50 PM	Yes	Yeah :) what do you want to do?
+13364805150	Jun 1, 2014, 7:59 PM	No	How about Starbucks? And maybe we can figure out something else to do after. I can anytime after noon...also, do you just wanna pick me up to make things easier? 
+17344782101	Jun 1, 2014, 10:10 PM	Yes	That works, I have a flying lesson until 12:30 that will probably go over, not sure how long though, I'll just come by and pick you up after that's finished? Probably 130 2ish
+13364805150	Jun 1, 2014, 10:14 PM	No	Sounds good:)
+17344782101	Jun 1, 2014, 10:57 PM	Yes	:)
+17344782101	Jun 4, 2014, 12:20 PM	Yes	So my lesson actually got out a little early, be at your house around 115?
+13364805150	Jun 4, 2014, 12:21 PM	No	Yeah that's fine 
+17344782101	Jun 4, 2014, 12:27 PM	Yes	Okay :)
+17344782101	Jun 4, 2014, 1:11 PM	Yes	I'm running a little bit late, will be there soon
+13364805150	Jun 4, 2014, 1:11 PM	No	Oh it's fine haha 
+17344782101	Jun 4, 2014, 1:31 PM	Yes	I'm here
+13364805150	Jun 4, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	Did I confuse you too much today? To be honest, I'm still kinda confused about how were gonna hang out in stuff 
+17344782101	Jun 4, 2014, 10:13 PM	Yes	I think I understand what you want, and respect it, and don't worry we will figure out how to spend time together it's just going to require some thinking
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 4:04 PM	No	"Seriously why the fuck do you think I'm a ""bad idea"" you like lied to me yesterday and apparently your hooking up with another girl so please go fuck yourself I hate you "
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	I'm only mad bc you lied about last night! You probably don't remember anyways 
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 4:21 PM	No	"Ok actually it's fine to hook up ith other people I'm not mad about that but I'm mad that you said you truly said you wanted to be friends but now they won't let me come over bc I'm a ""bad idea"""
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 4:37 PM	Yes	Lydia I do like you, and I do want to be friends, the only reason I said you are a bad idea is because clearly neither of us has any self control, I know that you don't want to have sex, and so I don't want to put us in a situation where that's what will happen. Lydia I can't see you this week, because it will almost definitely lead to outcomes that well both feel guilty about
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	I don't feel guilty tho 
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 4:40 PM	No	If you don't want to see eachother this week then that's fine but right now your making our relationship more complicated then it was before and I'm not very confused. I'm not super mad bc I was expecting you to take back what you said but I'm still disappointed 
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 4:41 PM	Yes	Lydia, I feel guilty, you told me not much more than a week ago that you wanted this to stop, and I really am trying to make that happen, right now we clearly need to stay away from each other for that to work
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 4:42 PM	Yes	I don't want to stay away, I just want to do what you said you wanted
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	I said I didn't want our relationship to just be about sex not that I wanted to stop sex 
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	I don't want drama or anyone to be mad but I'm still very hurt and I wish last night never happened bc you lied about wanting to hang at beach week again 
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 5:06 PM	No	And I'm also a little jealous that you were able to move on so fast and I wasn't interested in hooking  up with anyone else 
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 5:33 PM	No	Your actually disgusting everyone's surprised you got someone to hook up with you truth is I don't want to see you again 
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 5:52 PM	Yes	Lydia you did say that you wanted to stop having sex, and I agree that last night was a bad idea. I'm sorry that you feel that way but if that's what you want then I'm not going to argue with you
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 5:58 PM	No	Bye 
+13364805150	Jun 17, 2014, 7:23 PM	No	Literally all your friends are saying your an ass and you are and I hate you :)))) plz I hate your face 
+13364805150	Jun 18, 2014, 5:30 PM	No	You know I'm not psycho you've known me for two years your just trying to find faults in me when you know there aren't any
+13364805150	Jun 26, 2014, 6:15 PM	No	Hey I just wanna apologize for everything I said. We were both at fault and I hope we can move past it 
+17344782101	Aug 6, 2014, 12:13 PM	Yes	I apologize in advance for this question, but as far as your aware do you have any stds?
+13364805150	Aug 6, 2014, 12:12 PM	No	No 
+17344782101	Aug 6, 2014, 12:15 PM	Yes	Okay thanks
+13364805150	Aug 6, 2014, 12:15 PM	No	Ew sucks for you 
+17344782101	Aug 6, 2014, 12:23 PM	Yes	I'm not saying this to aggravate you, and you really probably have nothing to be concerned about, but I haven't been with anyone else since beach week 
+13364805150	Aug 6, 2014, 12:24 PM	No	Yes you have...you were with someone the morning after we hooked up. That's why I was mad and confused about everything...
+17344782101	Aug 6, 2014, 12:30 PM	Yes	Than you were mad and confused about nothing, I did kiss another girl that week, but that was after you bombarded me with angry texts
+17344782101	Aug 6, 2014, 12:31 PM	Yes	And kiss her was all I did, so can't have gotten anything from that
+13364805150	Aug 6, 2014, 12:34 PM	No	Connor, multiple people have told me not to trust the things you say so idk if I should believe you or not. That's what I heard that day from multiple sources so that's what I believed. I guess I didn't communicate why I was angry well enough bc I had been drinking so I'm sorry for that, it probably made me look dumb. But I'll get tested, contrary to what you said at beach week, I'm not a slut so id be surprised if I had one. Also there are no signs of one...Do you for sure have one? 
+13364805150	Aug 6, 2014, 12:55 PM	No	I'm sorry for being insensitive if you actually have one, I hope it's treatable 
+17344782101	Aug 6, 2014, 1:00 PM	Yes	I don't fault you for believing a scenario that my actions made you think was plausible, really didn't appreciate the drunk texts though, especially since I was sober and actually meant what I said. And you don't need to get tested yet. I only asked you this today because the doctor wanted to treat me despite the fact that the preliminary results said I was fine and I didn't see a reason to do that unless you had one. The full results don't come back for a few days but if your clean than I should be fine as well, I'll let you know when I do if you should get checked out as well.
+13364805150	Aug 6, 2014, 1:06 PM	No	Okay thank you I hope everything turns out fine 
+13364805150	Aug 6, 2014, 10:08 PM	No	 I hope this doesn't sound like an angry text, but I'm still confused why you asked me that when the results come back in a couple of days. Were you actually concerned with your health or did you want to slut shame me? 
+17344782101	Aug 6, 2014, 10:36 PM	Yes	It doesn't, the reason I asked today is because the doctor wanted to go ahead and give me the treatment before the results came back but I didn't really see the point in doing that unless I really had reason to believe that the problem was an std, especially since the treatment can have adverse side effects, I apologize for not making that clear earlier
+17344782101	Aug 6, 2014, 10:45 PM	Yes	Does it make sense now?
+13364805150	Aug 6, 2014, 10:46 PM	No	Yeah 
+13364805150	Oct 3, 2014, 1:20 AM	No	Hey:) how have you been?

+17344782101	Jun 23, 2014, 4:53 PM	Yes	It's not your fault, it's ridiculous that a medical condition of absolutely no relevance is such an issue

+17344781254	Jun 23, 2014, 4:53 PM	No	Seizures are a big deal

+17344781254	Nov 10, 2014, 12:14 PM	No	You are using a lot of data do you know why?
+17344781254	Nov 10, 2014, 12:14 PM	No	I will try to get you out of it 
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 12:22 PM	Yes	I don't, I'll try to stay on wifi though 
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 12:22 PM	Yes	And thanks
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 12:22 PM	Yes	Let me know soon if that's possible
+17344781254	Nov 10, 2014, 12:45 PM	No	Soon as I know! Are you able to take your final early?
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 12:46 PM	Yes	Depends on whether or not I have to go to jury duty
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 2:38 PM	Yes	Could you send a few more pics actually? I need one of just me
+17344781254	Nov 10, 2014, 3:17 PM	No	You didn't like the ones I sent?  What age do you need?
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 3:17 PM	Yes	I did, but I need to be able to replicate them
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 3:18 PM	Yes	And that age range is fine
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 3:18 PM	Yes	By replicate I mean take a picture now in the same pose
+17344781254	Nov 10, 2014, 3:19 PM	No	What do you want yo be doing. That is if i can find one of you doing it
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 3:19 PM	Yes	Anything is fine, just cute and easy to replicate
+17344781254	Nov 10, 2014, 3:21 PM	No	Probably won't be able to get them to you till later tonight
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 3:21 PM	Yes	That's fine
+17344781254	Nov 11, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	Did you get the pictures I sent?
+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 6:57 PM	Yes	I did will look at them soon, extremely busy, thanks for sending
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:33 PM	Yes	You doing anything today?
+13368165198	Jan 29, 2014, 12:34 PM	No	Yeah I'm at Meredith's with Merp Maddie Shap Sam Anna Josie McKinley Alex John Ida and Morgan 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:37 PM	Yes	Fun, what y'all doin there?
+13368165198	Jan 29, 2014, 12:44 PM	No	Making a massive breakfast 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 12:46 PM	Yes	Do you mean lunch?
+13368165198	Jan 29, 2014, 12:48 PM	No	Haha nope
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 4:06 PM	Yes	How would you feel about band practice tomorrow if school is canceled? Public schools already out
+13368165198	Jan 29, 2014, 5:32 PM	No	Fine by me
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:12 PM	Yes	No, I'm going to fratellis with Eric and Sam
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:16 PM	Yes	Who all is going to milners?
+13368165198	Jan 29, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	Oh Sam?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:17 PM	Yes	McKee
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:18 PM	Yes	I would go to milners, fratelllis is just so much better
+13368165198	Jan 29, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	I thought he was coming with us
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 10:48 PM	Yes	Not what he just told me, maybe you should come to fratellis, it is so much better
+13368165198	Jan 30, 2014, 12:30 AM	No	I've been before, I'm going wherever Josie wants to go
+17344782101	Jan 30, 2014, 11:01 AM	Yes	Okay, I'm getting many responses, are we practicing today or no?
+17344782101	Jan 30, 2014, 11:01 AM	Yes	I'm not*
+13368165198	Jan 30, 2014, 1:18 PM	No	Nope
+13368165198	Jan 30, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	Did your dad get my email that I sent Monday?
+13368165198	Jan 30, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	Nvm he got it
+17344782101	Jan 30, 2014, 8:18 PM	Yes	Okay
+17344782101	Jan 31, 2014, 12:32 AM	Yes	What's the theme tomorrow?
+13368165198	Jan 31, 2014, 12:32 AM	No	I'm not sure maybe blue and white
+13368165198	Jan 31, 2014, 7:30 AM	No	Blue and white
+13368165198	Feb 1, 2014, 11:26 PM	No	Come to Helen's, everyone's invited apparently
+17344782101	Feb 4, 2014, 10:32 PM	Yes	Do you have my projector?
+13368165198	Feb 4, 2014, 11:05 PM	No	No Meredith does
+13368165198	Feb 9, 2014, 11:27 AM	No	Where's my award?
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 8:35 PM	Yes	I don't give a fuck how you rationalize it, not showing up to a practice that you knew we were having is a dick move, and seven people who know their part individually does not make for a good performance, we are committed, we agreed to be committed, and this is completely not okay
+13368165198	Feb 11, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	I'm sorry
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 8:37 PM	Yes	If you were sorry you would cancel your trip, or postpone it until after practice tomorrow, how the fuck do you think Evan and David are going to take going to practice seriously if you, who bitched at them about it for a while, skips a planned practice to get drunk and get his dick sucked?
+13368165198	Feb 11, 2014, 8:39 PM	No	We don't have school Monday either
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 8:44 PM	Yes	I have my state meet, but hey, that's way less important than frat parties and college girls, right? Look man we already agreed to practice tomorrow, and you knew that, I've said my piece, you make your decision
+13368165198	Feb 11, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	What decision? I told you I'm already on the way, I've been on the way. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings but I want to spend time my family. Vandy doesn't even have stuff on Wednesday. You've said plenty and you ne'er say this to other people when they miss practice so don't target me when I finally do
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 8:58 PM	Yes	I'm saying a lot because I expect more from you, and something to keep in mind, this gig is as much for my father as it is for the band, we underperform and we are letting him down, and he did you a huge solid with this internship, and i say this only because any sense of appreciation or obligation that you may feel because of that favor, I feel a million times over, I am targeting you because this occasion is different, because I very much need this performance to be successful, I do not want to let him down, I know you don't think it's an option, but you can always turn the car around, again it is your decision, we really don't need to talk about this anymore
+13368165198	Feb 11, 2014, 8:59 PM	No	I agree and it's not my decision anymore. The situation is out of hands but as you always say no one cares about bass anyways
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 9:04 PM	Yes	Okay, you better have the parts down well enough to integrate seamlessly 
+13368165198	Feb 11, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	My missing practice won't mess up our concert dude it'll go well for us. Honestly, I think we have bigger problems than me right now in terms or learning music and playing well with the group. I won't be the one to mess us up unless nerves get the better of me. I wouldn't worry about if
+13368165198	Feb 15, 2014, 3:52 PM	No	Congrats again man!!! That's so awesome, I hope you choose to come to Vandy
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:21 PM	Yes	Thanks man
+13368165198	Feb 15, 2014, 4:22 PM	No	Do you think you will? And did you apply for any scholarships?
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:24 PM	Yes	At this point I don't know, I'd be perfectly content with vandy, but there are a few schools still ahead of it on my list, the fact that they want me enough to let me know two months early counts for a lot though, and no I didn't think I'd even get in
+13368165198	Feb 15, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	Oh mounts <3 
+13368165198	Feb 15, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	They want you bad, you're the only other kid in Winston Salem who I've heard of that has gotten in
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:35 PM	Yes	Damn really? Lorna is going to be shocked, I can't tell you how many times she told me regular kids don't get into vandy
+13368165198	Feb 15, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	You should laugh at her face
+17344782101	Feb 15, 2014, 4:56 PM	Yes	Haha nah, I think I already won that argument
+13368165198	Feb 16, 2014, 10:13 AM	No	Am I playing bass or piano during mountain sound?
+17344782101	Feb 16, 2014, 10:20 AM	Yes	David and Evan wanted to drop that song
+13368165198	Feb 16, 2014, 10:22 AM	No	I'm fine with that
+13368165198	Feb 21, 2014, 6:59 PM	No	I have your ticket
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 7:09 PM	Yes	Here
+13368165198	Feb 21, 2014, 8:50 PM	No	I'm here
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 8:51 PM	Yes	Okay
+13368165198	Feb 21, 2014, 8:51 PM	No	Are you?
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 8:51 PM	Yes	Yeah
+13368165198	Feb 21, 2014, 8:52 PM	No	Nope
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 8:52 PM	Yes	I'm not?
+13368165198	Feb 21, 2014, 8:52 PM	No	Let me in the front door 
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 8:54 PM	Yes	No
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 10:19 PM	Yes	Anything happening tonight?
+13368165198	Feb 22, 2014, 10:56 PM	No	We're going to my house after kk which were headed to now
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:36 PM	Yes	I apologize that was more harsh then intended, my point is we need you
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 11:58 AM	Yes	Another person from Winston got into vanderbilt 
+13368165198	Mar 8, 2014, 12:06 PM	No	Who?
+13368165198	Mar 8, 2014, 12:10 PM	No	Grace carter? She lives on my street
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 12:11 PM	Yes	Yeah
+13368165198	Mar 8, 2014, 12:10 PM	No	I think she got the Cornelius 
+13368165198	Mar 14, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	How's vandy?
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:09 PM	Yes	It's good, I probably need to come back with you, we are a little restricted
+13368165198	Mar 14, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	Haha I'm glad you want to
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:12 PM	Yes	Yeah that would be sweet, I like the campus, but have not had the chance to get a feel for the party scene, though I might get one tonight
+13368165198	Mar 14, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	It was number one Greek life in the country 3 years ago so I think you'll have a good time 
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:21 PM	Yes	Haha I'll have to come back with you then
+13368165198	Mar 14, 2014, 8:21 PM	No	I'm trying to get out there again and look for a roommate
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:26 PM	Yes	How is coming here going to help you find a roommate? The kids aren't here yet, also did you know you can request hall mates?
+13368165198	Mar 14, 2014, 8:25 PM	No	No but that's awesome, you Evan and I would definitely hall mate it up
+13368165198	Mar 20, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	When could you come?
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:23 PM	Yes	Visiting Faw at duke and having dinner there, so probably 1030 11 at the earliest
+13368165198	Mar 20, 2014, 10:25 PM	No	Why wouldn't you stay at Duke?
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:27 PM	Yes	Because Faw said I could, but I could tell he was busy and didn't want to impose
+13368165198	Mar 20, 2014, 10:27 PM	No	Turn down for what
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 8:52 PM	No	Duke??
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:53 PM	Yes	Wait listed, there as well as Harvard and columbia
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:53 PM	Yes	Don't know what the fuck happened really, I was quite confident about duke
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:53 PM	Yes	Tommy gun wait listed as well
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:53 PM	Yes	Quite strange
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	That's crazy man, what a freakin bummer. How about Penn?
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 9:21 PM	No	My dad just told me he got into Wharton?!
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:21 PM	Yes	For real? And me to!
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:22 PM	Yes	Your dad's going to wharton?
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	You got in?! No he got in a long time ago
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	That's fantastic!
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:23 PM	Yes	Thanks man! 
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 9:23 PM	No	That's great!!
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:23 PM	Yes	Yeah, I'm happy
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 9:23 PM	No	Guess vandy is out :(
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:25 PM	Yes	It's definitely looking like I'm going to penn next year
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	Good for you man!!! So exciting! I'm glad you got in...what if you get in Stanford?
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:27 PM	Yes	Thanks! And at this point if I get into stanford I'm going to stanford, if not I think wharton is it
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	You are king of the fantastic college fallback
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:37 PM	Yes	Haha I definitely lucked out
+13368165198	Mar 27, 2014, 9:38 PM	No	Nah, somewhere along the way you worked and earned it all
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 9:45 PM	Yes	Haha thanks man
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 6:46 PM	Yes	What time?
+17344782101	Apr 14, 2014, 8:28 PM	Yes	Your based is fixed, but the action is probably a little lower than it was before, you'll have to tell me tomorrow if you want it raised or not
+17344782101	Apr 14, 2014, 8:29 PM	Yes	And before you ask me to make it exactly as it was before, I can't because I don't know where it was, I need you to feel it and tell me
+13368165198	Apr 14, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	Okay thanks
+13368165198	Apr 15, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	Are you going to Reagan prom?
+17344782101	Apr 16, 2014, 7:29 AM	Yes	No, I don't really know any Reagan girls
+17344782101	Apr 23, 2014, 9:11 PM	Yes	One last thing for the internship stuff that you may already know, to code you will need either an IDE or a text editor, the best IDE for web development is Aptana studio 3, it is free, if you would prefer to just use a text editor, which is what I do, that works as well, the one that came on your computer will work fine but you may want to invest in a nicer one, it will make things considerably easier
+17344782101	Apr 23, 2014, 9:13 PM	Yes	On the text editor note, I may start using Aptana, I just haven't had a chance to familiarize myself with it yet, the IDE will provide significantly more functionality so you may just want to go ahead and get started with that instead of bothering with a text editor 
+17344782101	Apr 23, 2014, 9:17 PM	Yes	I apologize for sending so many messages, I've played with Aptana for 2 minutes and already understand it, definitely get Aptana, okay I'm done now
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 6:57 PM	Yes	How'd the game go?
+13368165198	May 2, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	We won 20-0
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 7:44 PM	Yes	Nice man, did you get a chance for a defensive score?
+13368165198	May 2, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	I got an offensive score 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 8:31 PM	Yes	Oh, that's not nearly as exciting
+13368165198	May 2, 2014, 8:49 PM	No	-_- 
+13368165198	May 2, 2014, 8:49 PM	No	We're at my house if you want to come
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 8:51 PM	Yes	Are y'all just chilling or planning on getting hammered? I'm kind of exhausted, also did y'all make the state tournament?
+13368165198	May 2, 2014, 9:23 PM	No	We're watching a movie
+13368165198	May 5, 2014, 7:32 PM	No	When are you doing your internship?
+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 7:34 PM	Yes	I'm starting Wednesday 
+13368165198	May 5, 2014, 7:34 PM	No	Really? I though you said we should do it together?
+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 7:36 PM	Yes	I'm going to be there more than thirty hours, well work together as much as possible, everyone else can start then and it's never going to be a good time for you because of lax
+13368165198	May 5, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	Just not this week
+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 7:38 PM	Yes	I'll catch you up when you can come then, it's really not that big a deal
+13368165198	May 5, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	Alright
+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 8:16 PM	Yes	When is beach week?
+13368165198	May 5, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	June 14th to June 21st
+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 8:19 PM	Yes	Thanks babe
+13368165198	May 7, 2014, 12:21 PM	No	I have practice today so I doesn't make sense for me to come for only two hours
+17344782101	May 7, 2014, 12:23 PM	Yes	Okay
+13368165198	May 7, 2014, 12:23 PM	No	Are we doing it Friday?
+17344782101	May 7, 2014, 12:24 PM	Yes	Yeah, tomorrow after lit as well
+13368165198	May 7, 2014, 1:18 PM	No	I probably have an away game Friday in Wilmington and tomorrow will be the same as today, y'all don't have sports which is unfortunate for me

+13368165198	Aug 26, 2014, 12:49 PM	No	Kinda shitty but I've still been drinking every night 
+17344782101	Aug 26, 2014, 12:51 PM	Yes	How many women so far?
+13368165198	Aug 26, 2014, 2:08 PM	No	None but I'm trying to build a strong foundation of bros
+17344782101	Aug 26, 2014, 2:16 PM	Yes	Haha I'm not really sure that's a valid excuse man
+17344782101	Sep 3, 2014, 8:48 PM	Yes	Rate her high, he's waited long enough and he's clearly interested
+13368165198	Sep 3, 2014, 8:49 PM	No	She's hot
+17344782101	Sep 3, 2014, 8:49 PM	Yes	Agreed
+13368165198	Sep 3, 2014, 8:49 PM	No	And I know that dude
+17344782101	Sep 3, 2014, 8:50 PM	Yes	I figured you did, but no one was responding
+13368165198	Sep 3, 2014, 8:53 PM	No	He probably only cares what you and I think anyways
+13368165198	Oct 6, 2014, 12:37 PM	No	Hey babe
+17344782101	Oct 6, 2014, 12:39 PM	Yes	How's it goin?
+13368165198	Oct 6, 2014, 12:39 PM	No	It's good, has your game picked up now that you're back up north?
+17344782101	Oct 6, 2014, 12:59 PM	Yes	Haha I couldn't tell you because there isn't a big enough sample of attractive women here to find out. Is Vandy all you hoped it be? 
+13368165198	Oct 6, 2014, 1:03 PM	No	There's a lot of really hot girls but almost every one of them has turned out to be mean
+17344782101	Oct 6, 2014, 1:08 PM	Yes	Mean as in shitty personality? As in your looking for a regular thing?
+13368165198	Oct 6, 2014, 1:09 PM	No	You're step in up Upenn ;)\LFAs in I don't want to fuck someone that is a mean person
+13368165198	Oct 6, 2014, 1:09 PM	No	It*
+17344782101	Oct 6, 2014, 1:17 PM	Yes	Haha that's definitely a good criterion, not something you consider in a drunk hook up though, how many girls have you been with so far?
+13368165198	Oct 6, 2014, 1:48 PM	No	Basically none
+17344782101	Oct 6, 2014, 2:13 PM	Yes	Respectable, quality over quantity is definitely the way to go, you found a frat you like yet?
+13368165198	Oct 6, 2014, 4:52 PM	No	Yeah I'm rushing several
+13368165198	Oct 13, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	"Look up ""method of the year 2010: optogenetics"""
+17344782101	Oct 13, 2014, 4:54 PM	Yes	I did, not sure I get though?
+13368165198	Oct 13, 2014, 5:11 PM	No	That where BME is headed
+17344782101	Oct 22, 2014, 11:54 PM	Yes	What are your plans December 28 through July 2nd?
+13368165198	Oct 23, 2014, 12:05 AM	No	That's a long ass time, I think my plans are called 2nd semester
+17344782101	Oct 23, 2014, 12:06 AM	Yes	Haha sorry, meant January 
+13368165198	Oct 23, 2014, 12:06 AM	No	I'll be in town I think, what's up?
+17344782101	Oct 23, 2014, 12:11 AM	Yes	My parents asked if I wanted to bring a friend to Atlantis, were flying private and the hotel is covered, all you'd have to get is alcohol and a few meals
+13368165198	Oct 23, 2014, 12:11 AM	No	What's in ATL? That sounds fun but I thought all the guys were spending New Years together?
+17344782101	Oct 23, 2014, 12:17 AM	Yes	Haha Atlantis, as in the resort in the Bahamas, and if they are I understand wanting to stay, probably pick that as well if I had a choice
+13368165198	Oct 23, 2014, 12:18 AM	No	When do I need to decide by? That's sounds sick and I definitely want to see you over break but I'm kinda drunk to give an answer tonight
+17344782101	Oct 23, 2014, 12:21 AM	Yes	Haha I figured that from the group text, and sooner is better, and like I said, I'd pick the reunion too if it's happening, so I won't be offended by a no
+13367936487	Jan 29, 2014, 1:14 PM	No	The gun is unloaded in the basement, so that's a good sign I guess. Who all was there last night? 
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 1:16 PM	Yes	That's good, Evan, Louie, Gabo and I, Eric was there for a little but he left before it got bad
+13367936487	Jan 29, 2014, 1:17 PM	No	Mmhmm. Okay. He said you guys were programming. Mentioned nothing of getting drunk and trying to drive
+13367936487	Jan 29, 2014, 1:29 PM	No	What is Louie's number
+13367936487	Jan 29, 2014, 1:29 PM	No	And was Eric around for any of it
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 1:31 PM	Yes	that's not surprising, just keep an eye on him, Louie's number is 3367757093, and not really, he left as it was starting 
+13367936487	Jan 29, 2014, 1:32 PM	No	Ok thanks
+13367936487	Jan 30, 2014, 10:43 PM	No	Hey man. Here's the Brian situation: he's quitting drinking bc that's when he gets suicidal tendencies
+13367936487	Jan 30, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	I'm confident that he's genuinely fine as long as he isn't drinking
+17344782101	Jan 30, 2014, 10:46 PM	Yes	That's a good decision, and just keep keeping an eye on him, did you end up talking to your dad or no?
+13367936487	Jan 30, 2014, 10:47 PM	No	No. I was about to, but as soon as I mentioned the whole situation he said he was done drinking
+13367936487	Jan 30, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	Look at it this way: I'm confident enough that he doesn't want to kill himself right now that my stress about it has been diffused. 
+13367936487	Jan 30, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	The biggest thing is just making sure he doesn't drink
+17344782101	Jan 30, 2014, 10:54 PM	Yes	Okay, you know him best, keep watching him though and if he still seems off after a while you might want to talk to your dad
+13367936487	Jan 30, 2014, 10:55 PM	No	Trust me. I'm watching just to be sure, but I don't think we need to be worried. 
+13367936487	Jan 30, 2014, 10:57 PM	No	I think he wants to have people up on the mountain this weekend. Thats a great reason to be sober. I just hope there's not a rumor spreading that he's fucking crazier than crazy.
+17344782101	Jan 30, 2014, 11:04 PM	Yes	That's good, and I don't think you need to worry about that
+13367936487	Feb 7, 2014, 12:19 AM	No	You still up? 
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 12:19 AM	Yes	Yeah
+13367936487	Feb 7, 2014, 12:21 AM	No	Can you send me the list of bills that passed
+13367936487	Feb 7, 2014, 12:20 AM	No	I'm struggling to remember which passed and which didn't, and I'm now just trying to take notes for tomorrow
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 12:25 AM	Yes	Pierce and Joseph will email it to you either tonight or tomorrow morning
+17344782101	Feb 7, 2014, 12:25 AM	Yes	You will have time to work tomorrow
+13367936487	Feb 7, 2014, 12:42 AM	No	Oh ok
+13367936487	Feb 8, 2014, 10:27 AM	No	If you're at the convention center, find a floater and tell him to do sb 23
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 10:29 AM	Yes	On the bus to the senate actually
+13367936487	Feb 8, 2014, 10:29 AM	No	God damn it somebody needs to point out how expensive that shit is
+13367936487	Feb 8, 2014, 10:35 AM	No	Senate chamber A is a total shit show. Barely any bill authors are here
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 10:36 AM	Yes	The docket is messed up
+13367936487	Feb 8, 2014, 10:37 AM	No	Yeah we can tell. We've played stand up/sit down twice and are now just hanging out doing nothing
+13367936487	Feb 8, 2014, 11:33 AM	No	You're sitting in the most boring chamber. I'm getting out of here and going to a different one
+17344782101	Feb 8, 2014, 11:36 AM	Yes	Haha I know, we just left, that room was terrible
+13363914954	Jan 29, 2014, 2:26 PM	No	What are you doing for formal?
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 2:34 PM	Yes	Don't know yet, sorry who's number is this? I got a new phone and some of the contacts didn't transfer
+13363914954	Jan 29, 2014, 2:42 PM	No	Eric

+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 4:32 PM	Yes	I think so, Corinne said she wanted to go with Hannah

+13363914954	Jan 29, 2014, 6:04 PM	No	I can ask if you don't want to
+17344782101	Jan 29, 2014, 6:08 PM	Yes	No I'll ask, probably us depending on how nice of restaurant we select, Sam is being cheap
+13363914954	Jan 29, 2014, 6:12 PM	No	Oh god. Where were you thinking? Have you been to fratelli's?

+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 11:55 PM	Yes	I don't know, I talked to him a little the other day and I think he is doing alright
+13363914954	Feb 2, 2014, 11:56 PM	No	Really? I think his sudden love of hard liquor and suicidal talk is disturbing
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 11:57 PM	Yes	I know but I think I guided him toward feeling that though emotions are just chemical reactions we still experience them and that life happens either way we might as we'll create as much happiness as possible
+17344782101	Feb 2, 2014, 11:57 PM	Yes	He really seemed to like that idea
+13363914954	Feb 3, 2014, 12:06 AM	No	Really? Or do you think he just agreed so he wouldn't have to discuss it anymore?
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 12:07 AM	Yes	No really, I ended the conversation because I had to go to my meet, he wanted to keep talking
+13363914954	Feb 3, 2014, 12:23 AM	No	Oh, well. Okay. Would it be weird if I talked to him too?
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 12:28 AM	Yes	No, you probably should, like I said I think he liked the idea, doesn't mean he did
+13363914954	Feb 3, 2014, 7:41 AM	No	Okay, I hope you're right
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	What time is amc tomorrow?

+13363914954	Feb 5, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	Oh shit, did everyone leave tonight?
+17344782101	Feb 5, 2014, 9:54 PM	Yes	No I'm special
+13363914954	Feb 5, 2014, 10:03 PM	No	Ohhhh I see
+13363914954	Feb 9, 2014, 3:33 PM	No	Hey, do you know what you're doing for your internship yet?
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 3:33 PM	Yes	Probably inmar, you?
+13363914954	Feb 9, 2014, 3:35 PM	No	I don't know yet. Do you know if your dad is looking for anyone?
+13363914954	Feb 9, 2014, 3:35 PM	No	Does he have an email address I can contact him at?
+13363914954	Feb 10, 2014, 10:09 PM	No	I have a feeling you might like a band called Your Vegas. Listen to The Way the War Was Won, I Wish You Were Somewhere Else, Your Vegas, and most importantly Salvador.
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 10:21 PM	Yes	I like it, it's got a little bit of Coldplay feel to it with a vocalist from a band I am a fan of but can't quite put a name to at the moment
+13363914954	Feb 10, 2014, 10:23 PM	No	I think Augustana and U2
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 10:30 PM	Yes	I can feel that, thank you for the suggestion, I will definitely be adding those to my current playlist
+13363914954	Feb 10, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	Do you want a cd? I'm burning one for Ben and I can make you one. He wanted twenty one pilots
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 10:41 PM	Yes	Absolutely, I have been more than impressed with your music selection so far and want more
+13363914954	Feb 10, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	Ahahahaha
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 10:47 PM	Yes	Actually I can just get it all on spotify, but I've never had anyone make me a cd so I want you to
+13363914954	Feb 10, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	"Lol it's like your first sexual encounter ""I want it to be with you"""
+17344782101	Feb 10, 2014, 11:17 PM	Yes	Well I want that to be with you as well Eric
+13363914954	Feb 10, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	Just gimme a call
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:29 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:29 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:29 PM	Yes	Significantly more noticeable on the iPad
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:30 PM	Yes	Did those come through?
+13363914954	Feb 24, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	Why is there a white bar?
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:30 PM	Yes	iAd
+13363914954	Feb 24, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	If that's for the iAd, you need to fix that. Apple rejects apps that don't hide the ad when it's not loaded
+13363914954	Feb 24, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	What you do is add the ad view off screen and move it on screen when the ad loads.
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:31 PM	Yes	Okay we will do that, the splash screen though? Image files are the right size, what the heck is wrong?
+13363914954	Feb 24, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	Also, maybe try cleaning the build, deleting the app from the device, and running again.
+13363914954	Feb 24, 2014, 6:32 PM	No	Is this your problem? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20862567/splash-screen-with-app-icon-effect-ios7
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:34 PM	Yes	Yeah
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:34 PM	Yes	But how do we fix it
+13363914954	Feb 24, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	What are your image dimensions
+13363914954	Feb 24, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	Also, are you doing any custom animations?
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:38 PM	Yes	 the dimensions are exactly as Apple wants them. There are no animations 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 6:38 PM	Yes	It's just an image 
+13363914954	Feb 24, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	Okay. Delete the custom icon from the project and run it again. Does it still fuck up?
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 4:34 PM	No	When do we have to be at inmar? I didn't realize tomorrow was for the internship.
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 4:36 PM	Yes	I don't think that it is for the internship
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 4:38 PM	Yes	I think some people who wouldn't otherwise go are going because of their internship, but you don't need to
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	Well did you see the email?
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 5:04 PM	Yes	Haven't read it yet, no
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 5:04 PM	No	Do you know what time we're supposed to go? Are we going together?
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 5:05 PM	Yes	Meeting there, and depends on the weather
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 5:06 PM	No	Where is it? I've never been
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 5:06 PM	No	The place you played music at looked sick though
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 5:06 PM	Yes	635 vine street, downtown
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 5:12 PM	No	Sikh. What time?
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 5:17 PM	Yes	Yeah just read that other email, you should probably come, and if normal start 8, if there is a delay we will go whenever school starts
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 5:18 PM	Yes	Do you know where the internship forms are?
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 5:29 PM	No	....I don't think school's gonna be starting at normal time
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 5:30 PM	No	Yeah they're on academics -> upper school -> senior internship
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 5:32 PM	Yes	Thanks, yeah I am with you on that one
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 5:32 PM	No	It's still coming down here
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 5:36 PM	Yes	Same, I am kind of getting tired of this snow to be honest
+13363914954	Mar 3, 2014, 8:11 PM	No	WSFC schools closed
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:37 PM	Yes	
+13363914954	Mar 4, 2014, 12:49 AM	No	Wen are we goin to inmar
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 8:54 AM	Yes	11
+13363914954	Mar 4, 2014, 8:58 AM	No	K cool. Where do we meet?
+13363914954	Mar 4, 2014, 9:04 AM	No	Yo, you know school is cancelled, right?
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 9:12 AM	Yes	We might not be going then actually
+13363914954	Mar 4, 2014, 9:13 AM	No	Alright keep me posted ladyboy
+13363914954	Mar 4, 2014, 1:27 PM	No	Can you print me out an extra form? My printer is broken
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 1:31 PM	Yes	Already on my way, can make a copy there
+13363914954	Mar 4, 2014, 1:32 PM	No	Alright
+13363914954	Mar 4, 2014, 1:46 PM	No	Wher are we meetin
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:07 PM	Yes	How did you get it to display your company name as the seller instead of your name on the App Store?
+13363914954	Mar 6, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	Did you fill out a company name when you submitted the app?
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:57 PM	Yes	Yes, the company name is on the copyright at the bottom but not the seller name spot
+13363914954	Mar 7, 2014, 12:00 AM	No	I believe I had to talk to apple about that. Are you switching to a company account?
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 12:04 AM	Yes	Eventually, we still need a duns number, it's not a huge deal but I read that it's slightly illegal and id much prefer stanford see the company name instead of Gabo's, so I was wondering if there was a quicker fix
+13363914954	Mar 7, 2014, 12:05 AM	No	What's slightly illegal
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 12:06 AM	Yes	Stating that something is being sold by an individual when it is actually being sold by a company, something to do with false pretenses
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 12:06 AM	Yes	I'm not really sure how it applies, or even if it matters because it is free
+13363914954	Mar 7, 2014, 12:15 AM	No	No one is gonna sue you for that, but it is a good idea to get it changed. I'd just contact developer support and ask them to change the display name. That's what I did, easy.
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 12:16 AM	Yes	Sweet, thanks man
+13363914954	Mar 7, 2014, 12:15 AM	No	Yeah babe. Congrats on getting the bitch approved
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 12:18 AM	Yes	Thanks babe
+17344782101	Mar 30, 2014, 12:12 PM	Yes	What tax form do you file for Taptools?
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 12:29 PM	No	Are you filing?
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 12:29 PM	No	We did a D403 1065 and 1065 K1
+17344782101	Mar 30, 2014, 12:41 PM	Yes	I don't know, I'm assuming we have to, but we had no revenue so maybe not?
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	I don't think so
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	But actually I don't really know
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	Check
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	Use the google
+17344782101	Mar 30, 2014, 1:04 PM	Yes	I think I might need to report expenses so that I pay less taxes on revenue next year, not sure how it works though, so I will
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 1:30 PM	No	Haha yeah you could save big
+17344782101	Mar 30, 2014, 2:40 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, I might not have to pay taxes on all 4 of our revenue dollars
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Hey have you heard Of the Night by Bastille
+17344782101	Mar 30, 2014, 10:08 PM	Yes	Listening to it right now, I like it, when did they append all these songs to the album?
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	I don't know, I guess they just decided to release b-sides
+17344782101	Mar 30, 2014, 10:54 PM	Yes	I'm happy they did
+17344782101	Mar 30, 2014, 10:56 PM	Yes	What question are we suppose to do for macro?
+13363914954	Mar 30, 2014, 11:56 PM	No

+13363914954	Apr 2, 2014, 10:07 PM	No	Do you know who's eating there?
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 10:13 PM	Yes	I think a lot of people are, shouldn't you be doing whatever your girlfriends friends are doing?
+13363914954	Apr 2, 2014, 10:14 PM	No	Haha yes, but she said she wants to do what I want to do since it's my senior year
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 10:29 PM	Yes	Haha well in that case I know that you want to spend it with me and will let you know what we are doing as soon as possible
+13363914954	Apr 2, 2014, 10:29 PM	No	Okay. I think people are eating at the thing, so that's what we'll probably do. Though I'm not sure if I'll be there in time or not anyway
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 10:41 PM	Yes	Sounds good, and you better be, or I'll be upset and spend most of the night sitting in a urinal and crying
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 10:55 PM	Yes	Don't forget, inmar at 8 tomorrow
+13363914954	Apr 3, 2014, 8:01 AM	No	Where are we supposed to meet?

+13363914954	Apr 24, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	Like author bio/personal life, poem, themes, imagery, devices, form, explanation, etc
+17344782101	Apr 24, 2014, 9:53 PM	Yes	Thanks, are we suppose to talk about other peoples analysis and give our own?
+13363914954	Apr 24, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	Not really yes or no. Wouldn't be a bad idea, but there's not really a rubric
+17344782101	May 7, 2014, 11:55 AM	Yes	When are we meeting at inmar?
+17344782101	May 14, 2014, 7:53 PM	Yes	You spending the night with mr Clifford?

+17344782101	May 16, 2014, 4:27 PM	Yes	Why do you think I wanted to go to Stanford? But I think you mean than in North Carolina, where we're going I think there will be a little less of a disparity
+13363914954	May 16, 2014, 5:11 PM	No	Lol

+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 10:28 AM	Yes	If you Clifford you will be more than prepared, I watched them all but if you just watch the ones with a title you think you need a refresher on you'll be fine, he doesn't add anything, just covers everything simply
+13363914954	May 18, 2014, 10:30 AM	No	I see. Wondaful
+13363914954	May 21, 2014, 9:47 AM	No	Oh fuck Econ was easy

+13368132145	Mar 30, 2014, 3:48 PM	No	What's the word with that school in California?
+17344782101	Mar 30, 2014, 3:49 PM	Yes	I'm officially a penn Quaker

+13368132145	Apr 6, 2014, 10:13 PM	No	I think shap and Hannah are going to so I don't think you want to be there anyway
+17344782101	Apr 6, 2014, 10:15 PM	Yes	I really don't think that would be awkward, also and we can ignore the merits of the following statement because I'm not going to ask, I'm sure Evan would let me come if I asked

+13368132145	Apr 17, 2014, 9:53 PM	No	Not at all. Who told you that?
+17344782101	Apr 17, 2014, 9:57 PM	Yes	That's what I thought, and I honestly don't remember, but I remember them being pretty confident about it so I was quite confused
+13368132145	Apr 17, 2014, 9:58 PM	No	Okay well they were wrong haha.

+13368132145	May 1, 2014, 8:32 PM	No	Dammit 
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 5:57 PM	No	Do you actually want to hang out?
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 6:23 PM	Yes	Yeah, why?
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 6:32 PM	No	why do I want to hang out? Why what?
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 6:37 PM	Yes	Why would you think I wouldn't want to hang out with you
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 6:52 PM	Yes	Also how'd tennis go?
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	We won, they sucked

+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 7:08 PM	Yes	Are you looking to go out and get turnt, or just chill
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 7:17 PM	No	Well if there is a party, the first 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 7:45 PM	Yes	Alright, haven't heard about anything yet, you?
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 7:45 PM	No	Nope
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	She regrets it, what else do you need to know?
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 8:02 PM	Yes	Nothing really, I just wish she would talk to me about it, haha also she's not the reason I wanted to hang out
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	Well I'm talking to her right now and I can't tell you most of it. But don't pretend you want to pursue it. Be blunt and clear the waters. You need to be blunt
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 8:30 PM	Yes	I understand, and though I don't want to pursue a relationship, she said she regretted it because she didn't feel like she really knew me, if getting to know each other would make her feel better about it then that is something I would really like to pursue, thoughts on the best way to convey that/get her to talk with me?
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 8:33 PM	Yes	I'm not trying to be difficult or manipulate her, I just really want to do what's best for her, and I think talking is an important part of that
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 8:38 PM	No	Nope, She's upset with you and with herself. And from what I can tell she wants to cut you out of her life. She's telling me personal stuff that I just can't tell you so that's why I'm being vague 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 8:48 PM	Yes	I know, and I know this is a lot to ask, but please try to persuade her to talk to me, I promise I am asking this with her best interest in mind, avoiding things just isn't a good way to deal with them
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 9:06 PM	No	Can I copy and paste that to her?
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	Of course
+13368132145	May 2, 2014, 9:28 PM	No	I did, and she said that she was sorry I'm in the middle of it
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 9:34 PM	Yes	It's probably for the best if you aren't

+17344782101	Aug 2, 2014, 2:17 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, unfortunately the girls here are either in a relationship or in a group with atleast one girl who doesn't want to do shit because she's ugly, also it's far as fuck so you probably wouldn't want too but if we could get a group of girls big enough we could probably have something in long grove 
+13367757093	Aug 2, 2014, 2:18 PM	No	Haha yeah that's far, plus it'd be hard to get girls to go...imma just try and get some HJs in the porta-johns

+17344782101	Aug 22, 2014, 1:43 PM	Yes	I don't think I'm going to go, looks like it's mostly for parents

+13366713320	Aug 23, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	She is happy for you and really liked campus.

+13366713320	Aug 26, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	How is it going?  Are you ready for first day of classes?
+17344782101	Aug 26, 2014, 6:43 PM	Yes	Things are going well, yeah
+13366713320	Aug 26, 2014, 6:45 PM	No	Great.  Make sure you are not tired in class.  Remember it is first impression time and when you look sleepy it bothers your teachers. 
+17344782101	Aug 26, 2014, 6:46 PM	Yes	I know, love you
+13366713320	Aug 26, 2014, 6:47 PM	No	Love you too!! 
+13366713320	Aug 26, 2014, 6:47 PM	No	Ps.  You are still the smartest sleepy guy I know.  ;-)
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	Good day for RUSS. 
+17344782101	Aug 28, 2014, 6:54 PM	Yes	I noticed, I'm still thinking hold, thoughts?
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	Sell half. 
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	Limit order. 
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	Nice diversification properties.  Smaller allocation probably appropriate. 
+17344782101	Aug 28, 2014, 7:18 PM	Yes	I might, limit price? Also have you seen the after hours?
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 7:32 PM	No	Did not see after hours?
+17344782101	Aug 28, 2014, 7:32 PM	Yes	It was up another 1.5 percent
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 7:34 PM	No	Limit at close plus 3%
+17344782101	Aug 28, 2014, 7:35 PM	Yes	Shouldn't I wait to see where it opens?
+17344782101	Aug 28, 2014, 7:36 PM	Yes	I've seen it fluctuate as much as 4-5 % between close and open
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 8:22 PM	No	Always best to wait until open if you have time and are unsure on price.  More information to you and then you can decide on optimal limit price.  However, if you have set your acceptable sell price and you put a limit in to that price the open is less important. 
+17344782101	Aug 28, 2014, 9:46 PM	Yes	Okay, the problem is that the stock is still trading much lower than I think it will within the course of this year, if I get out know it'll be purely for allocations sake so I'm not sure how that impacts my sell price
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 9:49 PM	No	On. Think it through and decide when ready.  
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 9:49 PM	No	Don't forget to include opportunity cost. 
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	That is comparing what you could make with the same money in another investment.  For example TNA 
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Make sense?  
+17344782101	Aug 28, 2014, 9:51 PM	Yes	Yeah I know, appreciate the advice, will decide in the morning, love you
+13366713320	Aug 28, 2014, 9:52 PM	No	Love you too. Miss you. 
+13366713320	Sep 1, 2014, 12:08 PM	No	Thinking about taking nick off road.  Where did you go that was near to Winston?
+17344782101	Sep 1, 2014, 12:14 PM	Yes	It's near lake Norman, but I don't remember how to get there, it's pretty out of the way and it's not well marked
+13366713320	Sep 1, 2014, 12:15 PM	No	Ok thanks
+13366713320	Sep 3, 2014, 6:13 PM	No	Noticed when we talked last night you were feeling the class demands. \LF\LFRemember you are at what is probably the best school in the world.  You deserve to be there and you have the ability to nail every class.  Your work ethic and discipline will determine if you lead and succeed.  \LF\LFNever again will you get the chance to have so much access to knowledge and to so deeply involve yourself in just learning.  Don't waste a minute of that chance.  Love you!!
+13366713320	Sep 4, 2014, 9:46 PM	No	Did you sell RUSS when it peaked?
+17344782101	Sep 4, 2014, 9:51 PM	Yes	Unfortunately no, my limit order didn't get executed. Also, I didn't think they would agree on a cease fire, and it crashed over the weekend so I couldn't get out. I do think the talks will fall through though which means it should rebound, would have been nice to get out and then buy back lower though
+13366713320	Sep 4, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	All good learning.  
+13366713320	Sep 4, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Love and miss you.  You ok
+13366713320	Sep 4, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	?

+13366713320	Sep 4, 2014, 9:56 PM	No	Understandable.  Pray for you all the time.  Here if you need me. Best son ever!

+13366713320	Sep 13, 2014, 1:47 PM	No	Know you are busy and having fun. 
+13366713320	Sep 13, 2014, 1:48 PM	No	But you need to block out 20 mins
+13366713320	Sep 13, 2014, 1:48 PM	No	And spend some quality time catching up with your mom.  
+13366713320	Sep 13, 2014, 1:48 PM	No	You are a good son.  Love you. 
+17344782101	Sep 13, 2014, 2:03 PM	Yes	Will do within the next hour, love you

+13366713320	Sep 15, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	How you feeling?
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 7:00 PM	Yes	Definitely much better

+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 7:03 PM	Yes	That penn is officially the best at everything?
+13366713320	Sep 15, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	Yes and applications will be up next year meaning acceptance will be even harder.  ;-)
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 7:17 PM	Yes	Interesting, did not think about that
+13366713320	Sep 15, 2014, 7:17 PM	No

+13366713320	Sep 15, 2014, 7:17 PM	No	Ok FaceTime when out.  
+13366713320	Sep 15, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	Gigi had to go just now.  So best to FT Kyle.  
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 7:58 PM	Yes	Okay, will do
+13366713320	Sep 15, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	Wells Fargo fraud prevention just called.They need you to call 877-316-2157.

+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 5:01 PM	Yes	Before would be better, going to gym after meeting, is fifteen minutes not enough?
+13366713320	Sep 18, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	That works.  Read into it that you might be tight on time but 15 minutes is good.

+13366713320	Sep 22, 2014, 6:24 PM	No	Solo cross country went well.  Was on a mental high afterward.  However, it made me more tired than I expected afterward.  
+17344782101	Sep 22, 2014, 7:31 PM	Yes	That's awesome, glad it was a success!
+17344782101	Sep 25, 2014, 10:49 AM	Yes	Hey, just wanted to confirm that you set up the money transfer for earlier this week?
+13366713320	Sep 25, 2014, 1:50 PM	No	My bad.  I set it all up and forgot to transfer.  Just did it.  May take a day or two to show.  
+13366713320	Sep 25, 2014, 1:53 PM	No	Check email for details. 
+13366713320	Sep 25, 2014, 1:53 PM	No	You ok or out of money?
+17344782101	Sep 25, 2014, 2:04 PM	Yes	It's fine, and I'm good on money, just thought I'd check in because you said Monday or Tuesday and nothing had posted yet, how did the TNA trade work out?
+13366713320	Sep 25, 2014, 2:05 PM	No	Covered call good but price down $8 share.  With all the leverage it is a roller coaster.  
+13366713320	Sep 25, 2014, 2:05 PM	No	Thanks for backing me up on the transfer.  
+13366713320	Sep 25, 2014, 2:05 PM	No	Got a lot going and forgetting a few things lately.  
+13366713320	Sep 25, 2014, 2:07 PM	No	It is on auto for next two months. Will resume when spring starts. 
+17344782101	Sep 25, 2014, 2:10 PM	Yes	Yeah, Russ and rusl have been moving like crazy, and I completely understand, you feel ready for the pilot exam?
+13366713320	Sep 25, 2014, 2:25 PM	No	Very close. 
+13366713320	Sep 26, 2014, 8:28 AM	No	Fyi I am being interviewed on Wharton radio at 11 if you are not in class and bored with nothing else to do. 
+17344782101	Sep 26, 2014, 11:06 AM	Yes	Unfortunately in class from now till 1150, how long will it go?
+13366713320	Sep 26, 2014, 11:36 AM	No	Just finished.  11-11:30.  They may replay. 
+17344782101	Sep 26, 2014, 11:39 AM	Yes	Okay, let me know if they do
+13366713320	Sep 30, 2014, 2:25 PM	No	Proud of you.  You come from a family of hard working smart leaders.  We do whatever is needed.  We are tireless and unafraid of any challenge.  Among those in our family that I have known before me or after me.... you are the best of us.  Love you!
+17344782101	Sep 30, 2014, 8:17 PM	Yes	Love you too
+17344782101	Oct 1, 2014, 5:29 PM	Yes	Wish I had a bit more patience, RUSL rebounded and then some
+17344782101	Oct 1, 2014, 5:39 PM	Yes	RUSS*
+13366713320	Oct 1, 2014, 6:21 PM	No	Good learning.  
+13366713320	Oct 1, 2014, 6:21 PM	No	Key to know your sell price on a stock when you decide to buy.  
+13366713320	Oct 1, 2014, 6:21 PM	No	The no mans land of should I go or stay is maddening. 
+13366713320	Oct 1, 2014, 6:21 PM	No	Fun stuff huh...
+13366713320	Oct 1, 2014, 6:21 PM	No	TNA has killed me. 
+13366713320	Oct 1, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	Buying on the dip with a long range view.  Plan to hold. 
+17344782101	Oct 1, 2014, 6:38 PM	Yes	Yeah, and I bet, the small cap correction has been pretty brutal in general,  so you think it's bottomed out and headed the other direction then?
+13366713320	Oct 1, 2014, 6:39 PM	No	Not sure on bottom yet.  Cost averaging in as it is a long term hold.  Jeremy's research shows diversified small cap generates best return over the long run. 
+13366713320	Oct 5, 2014, 12:54 PM	No	Called you this morning after my second solo CC
+13366713320	Oct 5, 2014, 12:55 PM	No	Learned something very valuable. 
+13366713320	Oct 5, 2014, 12:55 PM	No	Call me when good for you. 
+17344782101	Oct 5, 2014, 1:01 PM	Yes	Will do
+13366713320	Oct 5, 2014, 2:35 PM	No	Mom and I have to go to an event tonight.  Can you call around 4?
+13366713320	Oct 5, 2014, 2:35 PM	No	Earlier also ok. 
+17344782101	Oct 5, 2014, 8:42 PM	Yes	Meeting someone to work on math at 915, if you could call me before then that would be great, love you 
+13366713320	Oct 5, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	Thanks for letting us know. Glad you could talk to mom.  Call Nick and Lola.  I'll catch you later. 
+13366713320	Oct 5, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	This week. 
+17344782101	Oct 5, 2014, 8:55 PM	Yes	Will do, sounds good
+13366713320	Oct 9, 2014, 7:13 AM	No	Do you need an absentee ballot for election?
+17344782101	Oct 9, 2014, 11:45 AM	Yes	Probably 
+13366713320	Oct 9, 2014, 11:52 AM	No	ok..  do you know how to request it on line?  Deadline is tomorrow  
+13366713320	Oct 19, 2014, 6:24 PM	No	Are you calling us tonight?  Home number?
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 6:30 PM	Yes	Yeah
+13366713320	Oct 19, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Your family loves you.  You are an example and people look up to you.   Don't ever think people aren't watching what you do or how you act.  The people you know in college will tell others, employers and friends how you acted and what you did.  Be the best among us.  Not the average or less.  
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 8:32 PM	Yes	I love you all as well. Sorry for being short with you on the phone, truth is this past month has got me pretty down, I can't handle adding a fight with my family to the list. That being said, I'm not going to come to you or even meet you halfway. Right now I need to make my own mistakes and decisions. If the time comes when I feel like things are starting to get out of hand you will know, and I will ask for help, but until then encroaching will only frustrate and push me away. I love you and mom, and I know this is hard to understand, but right now the best thing you can do for me is give me space. Further, you are very off base about how I've spent my last month and a half, and I would appreciate if the two of you would stop imagining the worst. 
+13366713320	Oct 19, 2014, 8:38 PM	No	Ok. We have always and will always trust you.  No one here is doubting anything about this weekend.

+13366713320	Nov 1, 2014, 6:40 PM	No	Hey did you get the apartment?
+17344782101	Nov 1, 2014, 6:59 PM	Yes	That's awesome. And we  don't actually find out until mid December officially. But we were second in line so they said we should be fine.
+13366713320	Nov 1, 2014, 7:21 PM	No	Glad to hear. Love you. 
+13366713320	Nov 1, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	Did you go with 3 or 4 bed option?
+17344782101	Nov 1, 2014, 8:05 PM	Yes	4 bed, one of our guys still needs to get his app in so we're trying to maximize the likelihood of him getting placed with us
+13366713320	Nov 1, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Make sure he gets his app in.  Peer pressure is appropriate here as you could get an unknown. 
+13366713320	Nov 3, 2014, 2:26 PM	No	Regarding next week, which night is best for dinner?  Weds the 12th or Thursday the 13th?

+13366713320	Nov 3, 2014, 3:37 PM	No	I could try earlier. 6:30?  But seems tight.  Thursday after 7:30 works also.  
+17344782101	Nov 3, 2014, 4:42 PM	Yes	Thursday is probably better then, will put it in my calendar
+13366713320	Nov 3, 2014, 4:45 PM	No	Ok. Are you still traveling Friday morning?  
+17344782101	Nov 3, 2014, 4:46 PM	Yes	Morning or afternoon, not sure yet, depends on whether or not i can get out of my 3pm

+17344782101	Nov 4, 2014, 1:35 PM	Yes	The entire grade is arbitrated by the TA at the end of the semester, so if he says it's fine it's fine, if he doesn't it's not, and Italian sounds good, I will ask him
+13366713320	Nov 4, 2014, 1:37 PM	No	Italian it is. 
+13366713320	Nov 10, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	We have been invited to a Whalasa event from 7:30 to 8:30 pm on Thursday.  We can stay with dinner at 7:30 or move it an hour later and attend. Would you and Philippe like to attend and network for an hour before dinner or stay on schedule?  Attendees are MBA and Alumni who are on the board. 
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 6:42 PM	Yes	I will ask Felipe, when do you need a response?

+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	I'm doing the ninja game and my images are big red X's do you know why? 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:48 PM	Yes	Typically that occurs when the images can not be found, did you download the project resources and add the image folder to the project?
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	Nope I forgot that. Good call
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 9:23 PM	Yes	Tutorial pretty straight forward so far?
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 9:32 PM	No	Yeah I finished 
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	It was a lot of copying a pasting 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 9:33 PM	Yes	Haha you probably get more out of it if you type the code
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 9:34 PM	Yes	But yeah that's kind of what iOS programming is until you actually know what you are doing
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	Yeah I know. Now that I'm done I'm just going to study the code 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 9:44 PM	Yes	Helpful enough to merit getting the book?
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	Hell yeah 
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	I kinda wanna check out the ones they have at the book store 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 9:58 PM	Yes	Yeah I like doing that too, they probably won't have anything as focused on sprite kit development
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	Yeah I know. 
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	Fuck it that's the best one 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:13 PM	Yes	Haha go to the book store first
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:15 PM	Yes	The thing is 800 pages long
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	Yeah I know I saw that. 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:18 PM	Yes	And it looks like they have an apprentice series that covers objective c and basic iOS development
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	Yeah I saw that too. It looked nice
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	Can you buy them together as a bundle? 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:22 PM	Yes	Possibly, if not we could email them and ask, play the high school student card even and see if we can get a discounted price
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:22 PM	Yes	Also if you click the written tutorials thing in the top left there is some good stuff to get you started in iOS and objective c
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	Yeah I saw that. There is a nice cheat sheet. This guy is legit 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:24 PM	Yes	I know, actually we might not even need the books
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:25 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:25 PM	Yes	Shitty pic but these are all free
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:25 PM	No	I know I looked on there. There were a lot of sprite kit tutorials 
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:25 PM	No	Yeah I thought you saw those 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:26 PM	Yes	I hadn't, but yeah it looks like there are enough free resources out there for us to get a solid base
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:38 PM	Yes	Is the syntax starting to make any sense?
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:38 PM	No	Yeah I little. That beginner tutorial had some crazy shit 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:40 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, it's sweet though 
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:42 PM	No	I know. A lot better than the other shit
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:42 PM	No	Like making a label 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 10:44 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, sprite kit is way more interesting and powerful as shit, makes learning iOS dev a lot more fun
+17046570257	Mar 20, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	Yeah and it's fun when you are finished 
+17344782101	Mar 24, 2014, 4:16 PM	Yes	You here?
+17344782101	Mar 29, 2014, 6:46 PM	Yes	What's in that shake?
+17046570257	Mar 29, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	Peanut butter, oatmeal, protein powder, banana, and milk 
+17344782101	Mar 29, 2014, 6:59 PM	Yes	Thanks 
+17046570257	Apr 2, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	When do we have to be at Inmar? 
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 10:52 PM	Yes	8
+17046570257	Apr 2, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	Shit okay
+17046570257	Apr 2, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	Is it going to be good? 
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 10:53 PM	Yes	I don't know, I'm sure they'll try to keep it interesting 
+17046570257	Apr 14, 2014, 7:31 PM	No	Lifting 
+17344782101	Apr 14, 2014, 7:59 PM	Yes	What about it?

+17344782101	Apr 22, 2014, 6:53 PM	Yes	I don't know man, but if all perry ever did was play those videos we would have understood everything in a week
+17046570257	Apr 22, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	I know. A semester course 
+17046570257	Apr 22, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	1 week learning. 17 weeks jerking off
+17344782101	Apr 22, 2014, 7:15 PM	Yes	I know, Clifford is the reason I've spent the entire year just holding the pud in that class man

+17344782101	Apr 23, 2014, 5:26 PM	Yes	It's probably for the best that didn't happen, the cardio would be good for her but I wouldn't want her to miss her lift
+17046570257	Apr 23, 2014, 5:28 PM	No	You are so considerate 
+17344782101	Apr 23, 2014, 5:53 PM	Yes	Only if so considerate and such a pussy are synonyms

+17344782101	Apr 26, 2014, 3:43 PM	Yes	Are you sure the only reason they didn't give a fuck was because it was the last day of classes?
+17344782101	Apr 26, 2014, 4:03 PM	Yes	Is anything happening tonight?
+17046570257	Apr 26, 2014, 4:03 PM	No	Idk but it was so chill. And I don't think so. Gabo is going to a prom after party probably near your house 
+17344782101	Apr 26, 2014, 5:08 PM	Yes	Are you going to go with him?
+17046570257	Apr 26, 2014, 5:51 PM	No	No 
+17344782101	Apr 27, 2014, 11:24 AM	Yes	You're doing arms today right? I feel like you said something about legs and that didn't make sense
+17046570257	Apr 27, 2014, 11:32 AM	No	Yeah 
+17344782101	Apr 27, 2014, 11:59 AM	Yes	When are we going?
+17046570257	Apr 27, 2014, 12:23 PM	No	Now
+17046570257	Apr 27, 2014, 12:23 PM	No	I'm leaving 
+17344782101	Apr 27, 2014, 12:25 PM	Yes	Okay
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 3:02 PM	No	I'm at the y 
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 4:24 PM	Yes	My girl totally caught me checking her out
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	Shit. 
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	You have to go in now or it's weird 
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 4:26 PM	Yes	Haha no, she smiled at me though, I'm totally already in man
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:28 PM	No	She is so nice 
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:28 PM	No	Body builders love when you check them out 
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:29 PM	No	It's a different type of checkout 
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:30 PM	No	A good conversation started would be asking when she started coming to the y
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:30 PM	No	Because she is new 
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 4:32 PM	Yes	Haha I'm too sober, and that ass and those tits are too damn perfect
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:32 PM	No	Pussy 
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:33 PM	No	Just talk about lifting with get
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:33 PM	No	Her
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:33 PM	No	She is a girl that would understand 
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 4:34 PM	Yes	No dude, the gym bros are already on her, and I am just a brotege, I can't compete
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:34 PM	No	Damn it mounts 
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 4:35 PM	Yes	She just walked by me and totally intentionally avoided eye contact
+17046570257	Apr 28, 2014, 4:35 PM	No	Because she was trying to give you a good view of the butt  
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 4:36 PM	Yes	Haha maybe one day I'll grow a pair man, today is not the day
+17344782101	May 1, 2014, 6:47 PM	Yes	You and Lou eat yet?

+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 7:15 PM	No	We are going to gabos now
+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 7:15 PM	No	But Louis just got pulled over with all our liquor 
+17344782101	May 1, 2014, 7:15 PM	Yes	Pulled over for speeding or for the liquor?
+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 7:15 PM	No	Speeding 
+17344782101	May 1, 2014, 7:16 PM	Yes	That sucks, are you in the car with him?
+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 7:15 PM	No	No I was behind him 
+17344782101	May 1, 2014, 7:27 PM	Yes	You shoulda rammed the cop and ran man, did he get out alright?
+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 7:28 PM	No	Yeah he didn't even get a ticket 
+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 7:28 PM	No	Lucky bad yard 
+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 7:28 PM	No	Bastard 
+17344782101	May 1, 2014, 7:32 PM	Yes	Good for him, and your liquor, are y'all staying at Gabo's for a while?
+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 7:33 PM	No	Yeah 
+17344782101	May 1, 2014, 7:33 PM	Yes	Can I come?
+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	You have to ask Gabo. I'm at my house taking a shower 
+17344782101	May 1, 2014, 8:05 PM	Yes	Aight, well if you wouldn't mind saying something to him when you get there, that be great, he hasn't responded
+17046570257	May 1, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	
+17344782101	May 1, 2014, 8:07 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	May 1, 2014, 8:31 PM	Yes	Do you have the address for the apartment?

+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 6:54 PM	Yes	Doing anything tonight?
+17046570257	May 2, 2014, 6:55 PM	No	Nothing that I know of. Are you going on a date Corinne?  
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 6:56 PM	Yes	She's not texting me back and didn't talk to me at all at the thing today, not really sure what to do
+17046570257	May 2, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	Woah that's weird. Did you go up to her at the thing 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 7:00 PM	Yes	I wanted to, but she kept avoiding eye contact
+17046570257	May 2, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	That's awkward. She will come around 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 7:13 PM	Yes	Yeah I hope, it really is quite awkward
+17046570257	May 2, 2014, 7:13 PM	No	Good thing there isn't anymore school
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 7:43 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, still probably rather not leave things the way they are though
+17046570257	May 2, 2014, 7:45 PM	No	Yeah. What happen last night? 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 7:46 PM	Yes	Haha what do you think happened noble?
+17046570257	May 2, 2014, 7:47 PM	No	It seemed all right when you came down 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 8:03 PM	Yes	It was, but then she woke up and was being really weird about it
+17344782101	May 3, 2014, 12:12 PM	Yes	When are you lifting?
+17046570257	May 3, 2014, 12:18 PM	No	Later tonight 
+17344782101	May 3, 2014, 12:40 PM	Yes	And what workout are you doing?
+17046570257	May 3, 2014, 12:40 PM	No	All back 
+17344782101	May 3, 2014, 12:45 PM	Yes	Is that what you are doing for the cut as well?
+17046570257	May 3, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	No. Just last week 
+17344782101	May 3, 2014, 12:46 PM	Yes	What are you doing for the cut? I think ima start that this week
+17046570257	May 3, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	I have no idea yet 
+17344782101	May 3, 2014, 1:17 PM	Yes	How do you feel about circuit training?
+17046570257	May 3, 2014, 1:18 PM	No	Circuits are great for cutting but it's hard at the y because of all the people 
+17344782101	May 3, 2014, 1:19 PM	Yes	Not if we go at the right time, I'm doing one today, it's hard
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 10:53 AM	Yes	Are you going to lift and do cardio every day, or alternate?
+17046570257	May 4, 2014, 10:53 AM	No	Alternate core and cardio 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 11:07 AM	Yes	But lift every day then?
+17046570257	May 4, 2014, 11:07 AM	No	Yes. With one complete rest day a week 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 11:08 AM	Yes	What kind of lifting are you doing?
+17046570257	May 4, 2014, 11:10 AM	No	Today I'm doing biceps 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 11:14 AM	Yes	Are you doing one muscle a day for the cut too, or is this just the end of your bulk?
+17046570257	May 4, 2014, 11:15 AM	No	Just the end of the bulk 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 11:16 AM	Yes	Okay, any idea what you are doing for cutting yet or still no?
+17046570257	May 4, 2014, 11:17 AM	No	No I haven't looked yet. I will probably put something together tonight 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 11:19 AM	Yes	Okay, let me know, everything I'm reading just doesn't really seem to be enough of a workout
+17046570257	May 4, 2014, 11:21 AM	No	I'm going to stick with heavy weights so I can keep my strength during the cut. I fucked that up last time 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 11:23 AM	Yes	Haha everything I read said not to worry about strength training
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 11:24 AM	Yes	Thank god I have you so those fuckers can't mess me up
+17046570257	May 4, 2014, 11:23 AM	No	Last time I cut I switched to the high rep bullshit and lost so much strength 
+17046570257	May 4, 2014, 11:25 AM	No	I'm just going to make sure that I have a good meal before I workout so I have the energy and don't hurt myself 
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 4:15 PM	Yes	Doing anything tonight?
+17046570257	May 9, 2014, 5:25 PM	No	Apartment
+17046570257	May 9, 2014, 5:25 PM	No	You in? 
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 5:28 PM	Yes	Maybe, who's going?
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 6:33 PM	Yes	Noble?
+17046570257	May 9, 2014, 6:35 PM	No	I'm not sure 
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 6:41 PM	Yes	Alright, don't think Corinne wants to see me
+17046570257	May 9, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	But there are other people 
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 7:13 PM	Yes	Okay, what time?
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 8:22 PM	Yes	Noble? And address?
+17046570257	May 9, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	I'm sorry man but I don't think Corinne wants you there 
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 9:06 PM	Yes	Yeah that's not the case, why am I actually being uninvited?
+17046570257	May 9, 2014, 9:06 PM	No	Don't ask me dude 
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	Yasmines number then?
+17046570257	May 9, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	3364083071
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	Thanks babe, how'd your last week of bulk go?
+17046570257	May 10, 2014, 12:09 AM	No	It was good. I'm day three of cutting 
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 5:20 PM	Yes	If I lost 8 pounds this past week, do I need to be eating more?
+17046570257	May 11, 2014, 5:20 PM	No	Yeah 
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 5:24 PM	Yes	Alright, well my weekly weigh in is tomorrow so I'll see if that's accurate accurate, what's the target loss rate, and any idea how many more calories per day per pound too many?
+17046570257	May 11, 2014, 5:26 PM	No	1.5 pounds a week and how many do you eat now 
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 5:28 PM	Yes	Around 2500, fluctuates a little from day to day but not by more than 500
+17046570257	May 11, 2014, 5:29 PM	No	500 is a large fluctuation 
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 5:30 PM	Yes	Haha I'm aware, it's usually not that bad though
+17046570257	May 11, 2014, 5:33 PM	No	Well see what you weigh tomorrow. Make sure you are hydrated. 
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 5:33 PM	Yes	Okay
+17344782101	May 11, 2014, 7:54 PM	Yes	Did the snow ever fix your grade?
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 2:41 PM	Yes	What time are you lifting?
+17046570257	May 12, 2014, 4:09 PM	No	Later tonight 
+17046570257	May 17, 2014, 8:43 PM	No	House zalad with fried chicken, no tomatoes or cucumbers. Buffalo sauce as the dressing 
+17344782101	May 17, 2014, 8:44 PM	Yes	Okay, same for Gabo?
+17046570257	May 17, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	same
+17046570257	May 17, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	different check 
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	I forgot our house was full of a bunch of pussies 
+17344782101	Jun 4, 2014, 7:17 PM	Yes	Haha no, just people that don't like you, for the record that excludes me, how do you wanna do alcohol? I may be able to get some liquor I don't know where you are on that front, any requests? And I'm willing to split whatever beer we get fifty fifty, I'll just have to keep pace, and get real cozy with the toilet
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:19 PM	No	Because I totally give them a reason not to like me 
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:19 PM	No	I might just buy beer on the fly with you if you want 
+17344782101	Jun 4, 2014, 7:22 PM	Yes	Haha never said that you did, and that works for me, where are you on the liquor front?
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:22 PM	No	Yeah I'm not sure about the liquor yet. What do you have? 
+17344782101	Jun 4, 2014, 7:25 PM	Yes	Nothing, but there's a good chance I'll be able to get some, any preference? Also, any chance you can get any?
+17046570257	Jun 8, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	Someone is going to beach week and doesn't drink 
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 10:00 PM	Yes	That's weird
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 10:01 PM	Yes	Oh that was Avery, and he was kidding
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 8:26 PM	Yes	You should have asked mate, please tell me you didn't take half our stuff?
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 8:49 PM	No	Fuck that, y'all took almost all my stuff
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 8:58 PM	Yes	We didn't, people came in our house and took it, and you are right that it's our fault for letting that happen, but you should have just asked to be compensated, which we would have done, you also took much more of ours than what was missing of yours, which is kind of a dick move
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	If y'all would've compensated me then who cares? We are even and it was unopened before, now it has 1/4 in it...less than that
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	I seriously took less 
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	It was a handle 
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 9:08 PM	Yes	Your handle was half full, you took a full handle, asking is a nice courtesy but honestly at this point it doesn't really matter, did you just move your liquor or all your stuff?
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	Dude 
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	I will come back with everything and we can talk it out. I was drunk and angry  
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 9:32 PM	Yes	I don't think you get it man, obviously we want our alcohol back, but that's not the issue, you treat everyone here like shit and take advantage of them whenever it's convenient, I can't speak for everyone here, but I know that I have never tried to screw you over, and I don't want to, obviously it's your place as much as it's ours and we won't ask you to leave, but for your sake stop being so damn proud that you won't apologize for shit, it will catch up with you and it will suck, and I'm only saying this because despite what you may think I really just want to be a friend and have your back, I'm not fucking perfect, I'm painfully aware, but I really have tried, anyway, you handle it however you want man
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 9:32 PM	Yes	Sorry that's so long
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	Dude 
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	I don't careabout money or anything 
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	I just need alcohol 
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	And you guys took so much from me 
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	It was your girls and it's only fair 
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	Did you ask me permission for mine? 
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 9:42 PM	Yes	Evan, we didn't know they were taking it, like I said handle it how you want to handle it, I'm done trying to be friends with someone who doesn't give a shit
+17046570257	Jun 17, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	We can talk this out once I come back 
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 9:56 PM	Yes	If that's what you want, but like I said, I'm done, unless you can convince me your a friend, which I highly doubt, I'm not really interested 
+17344782101	Jul 7, 2014, 3:24 PM	Yes	
+17046570257	Jul 7, 2014, 3:24 PM	No	Hell yeah that's all you need. Where is that? 
+17046570257	Jul 7, 2014, 3:26 PM	No	Gabo told me about your app. Sounds awesome, but have you thought about how you are going to save it? 
+17046570257	Jul 7, 2014, 3:31 PM	No	I would suggest this thing called  core data. It's something I just learned and it would be perfect for what you are doing. 
+17344782101	Jul 7, 2014, 3:33 PM	Yes	At this kids house, custom design, his dad's the strength coach for the panthers, and yeah, I actually have that all set up, I wrote a data class that stores everything I need, and it's worked pretty well
+17344782101	Jul 7, 2014, 3:40 PM	Yes	But I hadn't heard of core data so I'll look into that, my current method works but I'm not sure it's the most efficient 
+17344782101	Jul 11, 2014, 9:53 PM	Yes	Have you played around with swift any?
+17046570257	Jul 11, 2014, 11:52 PM	No	Just a little. And with the playground why? 
+17344782101	Jul 12, 2014, 12:05 AM	Yes	Because Im curious as to how other people feel about it, I'm a big fan but want to know if that's popular sentiment or just me
+17046570257	Jul 12, 2014, 12:09 AM	No	I like some of the new features but I will have to get more into it. I don't really understand the point if you can do everything with objective c. What I really love is the new sprite kit 
+17344782101	Jul 12, 2014, 12:15 AM	Yes	I think the point is that it's more eloquent, and easier to type and read, it also has a few additional data structures, like tuples, which are pretty nice, what's in the new sprite kit?

+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 1:37 PM	No	I emailed you the background. what did the guy say?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 1:38 PM	Yes	Hasn't responded yet, I think he lives in a different time zone
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 1:40 PM	No	I guess we will add everything tomorrow and submit the app 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 1:40 PM	Yes	Works for me
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 1:41 PM	No	Check and see if you got my email
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 1:42 PM	No	have the background ready by tomorrow dude! I'm so pumped!

+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 4:30 PM	No	I logged into iTunes connect and our iAd contract is in effect
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:32 PM	Yes	Sweet, still waiting on a response from the guy
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 4:32 PM	No	alright that's fine, hopefully we hear from him soon
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 4:32 PM	No	we'll*
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:34 PM	Yes	He will probably reply late at night, all his other messages came between like 12 and 3 in the morning
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:34 PM	Yes	We are so close
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:34 PM	Yes	Spent most of the day on treehouse
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 4:34 PM	No	haha I know!!! have you worked on the background? what treehouse?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:37 PM	Yes	It'll be done by tomorrow, the website, I've been learning ruby, Ruby on Rails, and how to use github
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	haha oh so now you decide to learn ruby...
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:40 PM	Yes	Haha you were right, ruby is way easier, and with twitter bootstrap we could have a very nice looking website pretty quickly
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	fuck yeah! we are finally going to be a legit company haha
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 4:42 PM	Yes	Haha finally, it has taken forever
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	haha  I know dude, way too long
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:21 PM	Yes	Still waiting on the logo, but I just sent you two options for the background image
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:23 PM	No	I kinda like the 2nd background 
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:23 PM	No	more
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:23 PM	No	which one do you like?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:24 PM	Yes	I like them both, probably the first one a little better, just try them both and see which one fits better
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	okay I will
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	how big are the images? could we use them for the iPad version?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:26 PM	Yes	They aren't that big, we are releasing an iPad version?
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:27 PM	No	if you make the images big enough we could
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:29 PM	Yes	I can't envision this game on the iPad, but if you want to and those images don't work I will make bigger ones
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:31 PM	No	flappy bird is available for the iPad, all I'm saying is that if we make it available for te iPad we could potentially have more download 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:34 PM	Yes	Fair enough, maybe we release that later though? If I'm not mistaken we haven't even tested on the older iPhones?
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	we just have to put description that it will only work on iOS 7 
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	so if the older phones have iOS 7 it should work
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 7:36 PM	Yes	Is that because sprite kit is only in iOS7?
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	yeah, I think the particle effects only work on iOS 7 and on 
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	the pictures you send me won't work 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:08 PM	Yes	For iPad or for iPhone?
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	both
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:09 PM	Yes	Why?
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	I'm not sure but every time I try to use them the background is just black
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:10 PM	Yes	are you sure that that is not something on your end?
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	make the images dimensions to 1536 pixels X 2048 pixels
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	yeah positive
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	The dimensions are set for the iPhone 5, that isn't the issue, you may be zoomed in to a black space of the image?
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:12 PM	No	well then it should be working
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:12 PM	No	but it's not
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:13 PM	No	send me another image with those dimension 
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:14 PM	No	the code is write I'm 100% positive
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:14 PM	No	right*
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:19 PM	Yes	Am about to resend, using the illustrator iPhone template, dimensions are accurate, jpg or png?
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	do png
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	but send it to me with the dimension I told you
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	then it will work for both iPhone and iPad 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:22 PM	Yes	I will send two separate images
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	okay 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 9:35 PM	Yes	We have to pick between the white and gray, I vote white
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:30 PM	Yes	Sent you the logo, will crop the space ship and send soon
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 10:32 PM	No	alright sweet, I can't get the background to work 
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 10:32 PM	No	I don't know what's wrong
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:43 PM	Yes	I just sent the spaceship let me know if that works or if you need me to crop it differently
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:43 PM	Yes	You can figure it out, I believe in you man, we are so close, 100% positive the images are right
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	okay I'll work on it
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	make a launch image for the app
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:47 PM	Yes	The launch image is supposed to be either our company logo or company name
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:47 PM	Yes	No logo, so the splash image is just out name on a colored background
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 10:48 PM	No	that's so lame though
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 10:48 PM	No	alright well just make one like you said
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 10:48 PM	No	because we still need one
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 10:52 PM	Yes	Ill work on it, and we'll make it better later
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	okay sounds good
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 11:14 PM	Yes	Just sent a temporary splash image, que piensas?
+13367458849	Feb 23, 2014, 11:16 PM	No	idk, just make it even simpler than that, I'll add everything else tomorrow, I'm going to bed 
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 9:36 AM	No	everything is working except for the backgrounds you sent me
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:03 AM	Yes	You can figure it out man I know you can
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 11:29 AM	No	the images you send me are huge 
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 11:30 AM	No	that's the problem 
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 11:31 AM	No	you sent me the image 3567 pixels by 1134 pixels
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 11:31 AM	No	that is enormous! that's why its not working
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 12:32 PM	Yes	We will figure it out later today
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 2:00 PM	Yes	Can I come around 4?
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 2:22 PM	No	come now
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 3:16 PM	Yes	Almost there
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 3:16 PM	No	okay
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 8:56 PM	No	fixed it
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 8:57 PM	Yes	I knew you could do it, what had I broken?
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 9:05 PM	No	I'm never going to let you code again. When you were adding the code in order to change the background depending on the device you were creating two SKSpriteNodes with the same name (background) so it would crash 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:08 PM	Yes	Haha fair enough, however I'm not entirely convinced that that was the problem, it worked after I did that, it started crashing after I hit that migrate button
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:09 PM	Yes	But it sounds like reverting that back to the way it was worked so it doesn't really matter, you figure out the splash screen?
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	I also fixed the launch image
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	you had the wrong image in there 
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	from now on you are only handling the business end
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:15 PM	Yes	Haha fair enough, does that mean that the app is finished??
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	yeah, I just have to remove the iAd whenever there is no internet connection 
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	but we are set
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:17 PM	Yes	Fuck yeah man, does this mean that we (just using that word, I am aware that you deserve the vast majority of the credit) are releasing tomorrow?
+13367458849	Feb 24, 2014, 9:19 PM	No	That's the plan, come over after school so we can submit it together 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:30 PM	Yes	Sweet
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 2:34 PM	Yes	What time do you want me at your house?
+13367458849	Feb 25, 2014, 2:41 PM	No	4
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 3:31 PM	Yes	Text me when you are ready to go
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:29 AM	Yes	The name of the app is atomic dodge correct?
+13367458849	Feb 28, 2014, 11:38 AM	No	yeah why?
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:40 AM	Yes	I'm writing my update for Stanford
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:40 AM	Yes	How is Mexico?
+13367458849	Feb 28, 2014, 11:40 AM	No	haha okay lets just hope it doesn't get rejected by Apple
+13367458849	Feb 28, 2014, 11:41 AM	No	I'm getting ready to go to my pharmacies big event
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:41 AM	Yes	Haha hopefully, and I just told them it's been submitted for review not that it's on the market yet
+13367458849	Feb 28, 2014, 11:41 AM	No	there's supposed to be over 3000 people
+13367458849	Feb 28, 2014, 11:41 AM	No	hahaha
+13367458849	Feb 28, 2014, 11:41 AM	No	alright good
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 11:41 AM	Yes	Haha that is awesome, is it like a 3000 people party or just a lot of people standing around?
+13367458849	Feb 28, 2014, 11:44 AM	No	there's a mass first because people in Mexico are very religious, then we all go to this massive dinner/lunch and the party starts
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 3:30 PM	Yes	Anything from apple?
+13367458849	Mar 2, 2014, 4:34 PM	No	no
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 4:41 PM	Yes	How'd the party go?
+13367458849	Mar 2, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	it was a lot of fun
+13367458849	Mar 2, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	the after party was better
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 4:42 PM	Yes	Haha nice, are you back in the states yet?
+13367458849	Mar 2, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	nope, I'm staying here for another week because some asshole stole our passports and green cards
+13367458849	Mar 2, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	Actually I don't think I'll be back until next Wednesday 
+13367458849	Mar 2, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	so I'm not going to the bahamas anymore
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 4:59 PM	Yes	Shit man I'm sorry, I suppose there are worse places to be stuck than Mexico though
+13367458849	Mar 2, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	I guess
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	THE APP HAS BEEN APPROVED!
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:18 PM	Yes	Fuck yeah man! We need to celebrate when you get back, we are finally a real company!
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	haha I know I'm so pumped, it says it will be available in the AppStore in 24 hours 
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:20 PM	Yes	That is awesome! How's the documents situation going?
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	pretty good after a fuckin week haha I'm coming back tomorrow but I still can't go to the bahamas because I won't get my green card in like a month all I have is a letter from the American embassy that allows us to enter one time into the US
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	it's for Lykos to make some bank in the AppStore 
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	time*
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:41 PM	Yes	Haha that's good, and shit I'm sorry about the Bahamas, and hell yeah, all of that spending money is finally going to pay off
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:42 PM	Yes	We need to start advertising
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	yeah will shit happens haha it will be like very simple advertising, posts on Facebook, Twitter , Instagram, ask hayden lineburger to help us, tell our friends to help us etc
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:45 PM	Yes	No I think we should just throw more money at it
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:45 PM	No	you are joking right? haha
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:47 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, and I agree, I think that we can get a pretty solid number of downloads using those avenues
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	we could defenitly get a solid amount of downloads
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:52 PM	No	https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/atomic-dodge/id829345978?mt=8
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:55 PM	Yes	I am so pumped man, congrats again
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	I know! haha we need to celebrate for sure
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 9:58 PM	Yes	I agree, we do need to fix one slight issue however, the screenshot that we used has cosmos dodge as the title
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	haha shit.. we'll fix that later
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:03 PM	Yes	Haha alright, on a side note there are legal issues with having your name listed as the seller, it has to be the company name, well probably have to talk to Eric to figure out how to change that
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 10:04 PM	No	alright
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:17 PM	Yes	Sorry to bring this shit up, but in the unlikely case that we were sued you wouldn't be protected by the llc and all of your personal assets would be game, of course it's also technically illegal and I'd prefer Stanford not see that
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	well I can't change it because the account is under my name and not the companies
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:23 PM	Yes	I'm aware, I don't think it will be an issue, but it's not worth the risk, we may have to try to get that number again and register a company account and transfer ownership, which I would pay for, unless Eric knows another way
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	alright but you have to figure it out then
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:24 PM	Yes	Haha I will, if you won't let me code I have to contribute something to the company
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 10:24 PM	No	haha we all know what happens when you code
+17344782101	Mar 6, 2014, 10:25 PM	Yes	Haha lets not talk about it
+13367458849	Mar 6, 2014, 10:24 PM	No	haha deal 
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:29 AM	No	are the ads working when you play atomic dodge?
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:31 AM	Yes	I will check, but I'm 90 percent positive we still need to turn that on in iTunes connect
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:31 AM	No	its on 
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:32 AM	No	everything is enabled 
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:32 AM	No	and it says the app is receiving live ads
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:32 AM	No	but it's not showing
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:33 AM	No	sent an email to aid support and now I'm waiting to see what they tell me
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:36 AM	Yes	Yeah, I am not getting any ads either
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	maybe it has like a 24 hour delay
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	we just have to wait and see what iAd tells us
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	because the test ads worked fine
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:39 AM	Yes	Maybe, this morning was the first time I was actually able to find the app via searching, before I could only find it with the link, everything might run on a delay
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	give the app a review 
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	That is what I am hoping
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	haha
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:41 AM	Yes	Haha yeah, and I can't do that, we aren't resorting to those tactics yet, and we need to fix that screenshot ASAP, the error is a lot more blatant then I first thought, as the image shows when you search for the app
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:42 AM	No	I'll fix everything and add an update next week with the iPad capabilities
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:44 AM	Yes	Sounds good, also I talked to Eric about the seller name thing and he said we are going to need to call app support and have them change it for us
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:45 AM	No	alright
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:46 AM	Yes	Sweet, what time is your flight back to the states?
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:49 AM	No	1:30 but I won't get home untill like 10:30 because it will probably take forever to clear customs 
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:49 AM	No	ask Eric about the iAds 
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:51 AM	Yes	I will, we should wait to get our friends to download the app until there are adds
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:56 AM	No	I want them to be working 
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:56 AM	Yes	Same
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 8:22 PM	Yes	I'm going to start working on the images for the power ups, what all do you want?
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	I can do that, start working on your app idea
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 9:34 PM	Yes	Okay, you back?
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 9:35 PM	No	yeah just got home
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	the ads are still not working 
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:45 PM	Yes	Yeah I noticed
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:45 PM	Yes	I guess double check the iTunes connect settings?
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	I did, I honestly have no idea what's wrong, I'm waiting for the iAd support team to email me back
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:51 PM	Yes	That might take a while or not happen, you are better off calling
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	i might do that tomorrow then
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 10:54 PM	Yes	You might have to wait till Monday actually, not sure they take calls during the weekend
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:57 PM	No	haha okay
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	iAds are such a pain
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	like whenever you quit the app and run it again the white banner appears and then goes away
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	wtf
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 11:00 PM	Yes	I'm not even getting a banner
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	it should work!! everything is set, our bank and tax info is set, the iAd network is enabled in the app and it says that the app is recieving love ads 
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	live*
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 11:02 PM	Yes	Yeah that doesn't make any sense, have you asked Eric?
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	he said google it and I did and one guy a similar problem and he fixed it by adding an update to his app 
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 11:06 PM	Yes	Just an empty update?
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 11:07 PM	No	yeah I think thats what he did
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 11:07 PM	No	it's obviously not the code because it worked fine when we tested it and the test ads worked fine
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 11:09 PM	Yes	Yeah, and you've fixed things by just resetting them before, maybe just wait till Monday to call, we have to call about the name thing anyway
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 11:09 PM	No	alright 
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 11:09 PM	No	sounds good 
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 11:13 PM	No	I'll submit the update for the iPad version tomorrow nightand we'll see what happens
+17344782101	Mar 7, 2014, 11:25 PM	Yes	Sounds good, are you changing the screenshots with the update?
+13367458849	Mar 7, 2014, 11:26 PM	No	yeah I am haha
+13367458849	Mar 8, 2014, 9:28 AM	No	169 downloads so far
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 10:18 AM	Yes	Holy shit that's awesome, how'd we get so many?
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 10:20 AM	Yes	Also, the high score and score dont show up on the iPad mini
+13367458849	Mar 8, 2014, 10:23 AM	No	I have no idea haha yeah cause it's not made for the iPad yet 
+13367458849	Mar 10, 2014, 10:27 PM	No	the ads are finally working haha there was like a 4 day delay 
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 10:22 PM	Yes	Haha sweet, made any money yet?

+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:23 PM	No	
+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:23 PM	No	that is Tooky 
+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:24 PM	No	
+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:24 PM	No	that is Dr. Crazybird
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 10:26 PM	Yes	Haha nice, and what do you do in tookybird? And where did you get those images?
+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:27 PM	No	I drew them haha and it will sort of be like flappy bird but it will have a storyline 
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 10:29 PM	Yes	Shit Gabo since when did you get so good at drawing? And sweet, can't wait to see it, emphasize on see, not touch and break
+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:29 PM	No	I've been so bored that I started drawing on my ipad haha okay
+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:29 PM	No	how is the Dr
+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:30 PM	No	DR?

+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	have a safe flight puto
+13367458849	Mar 12, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	I'll show you my progress of tookybird when you get back

+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 1:26 AM	Yes	Does the update add support for the iPhone 4?
+13367458849	Mar 14, 2014, 8:56 AM	No	no
+13367458849	Mar 14, 2014, 8:56 AM	No	only for iPad 
+13367458849	Mar 17, 2014, 12:52 PM	No	Can't talk right now...I'll call you later.
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 12:53 PM	Yes	No need, was just wondering if you wanted to go to the kraze
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 1:01 PM	Yes	Chipotle then lift
+13367458849	Mar 17, 2014, 1:04 PM	No	I can't I have a shit ton of work to make up
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 1:06 PM	Yes	Okay
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 10:14 PM	Yes	I updated the website, let me know if you want me to change anything
+13367458849	Mar 17, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	Its good for now, it is simple but all our info is accessible. When the update for Atomic Dodge comes out we should put some screen shots of the game 
+13367458849	Mar 17, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	on the website
+13367458849	Mar 17, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	start learning sprite kit
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 10:26 PM	Yes	Sounds good, and I will, mobile site works now as well
+13367458849	Mar 17, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	alright sweet
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:42 PM	Yes	Can you push tooky bird to git hub? I am not going to mess with the actual copy of the project I've just been messing around in sprite kit and had some things I would like to try, we wouldn't use them unless you liked them and the actual copy of the code won't be changed at all
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 7:45 PM	No	I'm super busy right now and I don't really know how to put it on github but google flappy bird xcode and there is a great tutorial online that I used also youtube youtube sprite kit game and watch the first video 
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 7:45 PM	No	those are the best tutorials I've found
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 7:45 PM	No	you'll learn a shit ton 
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:47 PM	Yes	I know, I've been on tutorials for the past couple of hours, and that's fine I'll put it up there next time I'm over, again I won't do a thing to your code unless you like it, I just want to see the way some of the things look with the tooky bird graphics
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	alright, let's get together soon to work on the game
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:49 PM	Yes	Sounds good
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 7:51 PM	No	try to understand the contact delegate in the physics engine in sprite kit, I'm still kinda confused about it 
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:52 PM	Yes	The contact delegate is usually just going to be the scene
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 7:52 PM	No	I know 
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:52 PM	Yes	A delegate is basically
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 7:52 PM	No	the way it works though
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:52 PM	Yes	Alright
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:53 PM	Yes	A delegate is what is notified when some event happens
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	I know I just don't understand how it tells when the two objects collide
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	I'll explain my self better tomorrow
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:54 PM	Yes	Okay
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:57 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:57 PM	Yes	If picture is too shitty just look at the contactTestBitMask documentation when you get achancr
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	yeah and you have to assign a contactTestBitMask so it be something like \LF\LFenum{\LFCollisionObject1 1<<1,\LFCollisionObject2 1<<2 \LF}\LF\LFobject1.physicsBody.categoryBitMask = CollisionObject 1 \LF\LFobject1.physicsBody.contactTestBitMask = Collision object2 
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	I don't really get the enum part
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 8:03 PM	Yes	Very over simplified, because it's all I know, because you have a 32 bit operating system you are limited to 32 different categories
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 8:03 PM	Yes	What the enum does is assign each object type to one of those 32 possible spots
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 8:04 PM	Yes	You then later use that to identify what kind of object something is in the physics world
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 8:04 PM	Yes	So when you create
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	oh okay that makes sense
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 8:05 PM	Yes	Alright, I'll stop there then
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 8:06 PM	Yes	Then when you create a new sprite you say what type it is by associating it with that enum
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 8:06 PM	Yes	Sorry last bit had to be added
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	haha alright, thanks I get it now
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	have you started your comp sci game?
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 8:07 PM	Yes	Haven't even thought about it, why?
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	haha cause I haven't either
+13367458849	Mar 18, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	I wanted to make sure I wasn't the only one
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 4:40 PM	Yes	You coming?
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 4:50 PM	No	Just got home
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 4:50 PM	No	It would not be worth to just for for 30 min
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 4:50 PM	No	go

+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:17 PM	No	and I saw a game that was on there that is now on the top charts
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:18 PM	Yes	I think we need to research this a little bit deeper first, I agree that we should start getting our app out there, but I guarantee you that a lot of sites out there are gimmicks
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:18 PM	Yes	You seeing that May have been coincidence, may mean they are successful, or may just be a marketing ploy of 96apps
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:19 PM	Yes	We want to make sure that we are spending our add dollars as eventually as possible
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	its 5 dlls for a day 
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	and 15 for three
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	they use paypal
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:20 PM	Yes	I know that it's cheap, and I know that it's convenient, but that in of itself is a direct indicator that we need to look into it a little deeper
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	I will use my own money, but the app needs to be advertized 
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	advertised 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:20 PM	Yes	I agree
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:20 PM	Yes	And if you decide that you want to do it use the company account
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:21 PM	Yes	It's fine, I'm just saying in general
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	you haven't even posted it on you fb
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:21 PM	Yes	We need to research these things more before we make decisions
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:21 PM	No	its 15 dlls
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:22 PM	Yes	The price doesn't matter
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:22 PM	Yes	If it was 100 dollars and we know it would put us on the top of the charts we'd do it
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:22 PM	Yes	If it's 15 that isn't going to get us anything then what's the point?
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:22 PM	No	yeah it does, trust me ive done my research and the best sites cost like 500 dlls
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	they guarantee us like 1500 impressions
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	thats a lot
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:26 PM	Yes	That is almost twice what we are paid per impression, and if you are comfortable with your research then I trust you to go for it, I am just saying that if you only want to use this site because it's cheap that's not necessarily a good way to operate
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	we need to get our app out there starting with small advertising companies like this one
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	if you are prepared to spend 500 bucks or more then go for it
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:38 PM	Yes	I agree, and I don't want spend 500 dollars, I'm just saying we need to be sure we pick the best small company, please don't get defensive about this, I'm not trying to contradict you or be difficult I just want to make the best use of our money going forward, because we haven't been doing a great job of that up to this point and I will fully admit that that is mostly my fault
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:40 PM	No	Dude it is literally 15 dlls... check the website out and read their statistics  
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:40 PM	No	They have like 3400 average visitors

+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	I think its a good deal and I will literally pay those 15 dlls
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:43 PM	Yes	Gabo if you feel like it's a good investment then I trust you, we can go ahead and make it
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 8:43 PM	Yes	I'm just saying that we really need to make sure that we're getting the most bang for our very limited advertising dollars
+13367458849	Mar 20, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	I'm just saying that this will cost is a meal at kimonos.. haha honestly worst case scenario we get less downloads than we expected, but we still get more downloads hahaha I think you are over analyzing this

+13367458849	May 23, 2014, 7:45 PM	No	so it supposed to be on the AppStore soon
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	Would you like to acquire my share of lykos, or file articles of dissolution? Articles of dissolution will terminate the llc, no more filing fees, taxes, etc. You do technically need a company account with apple to submit collaborative apps but what you want to do is of course up to you. Giving up my share of lykos is not a play, I just have no use for it, and you might, let me know what you decide, I'm fine either way but this is something that we do have to settle.
+13367458849	May 26, 2014, 2:22 PM	No	The company is a pain in the ass
+13367458849	May 26, 2014, 2:22 PM	No	lets just get rid of it
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 2:23 PM	Yes	Okay
+13367458849	May 26, 2014, 2:22 PM	No	it has only cost problems and money, I really don't need it. 
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 2:25 PM	Yes	That's fine, like I said it's entirely up to you, but I can't do either without your knowledge/approval
+13367458849	May 26, 2014, 2:26 PM	No	okay, well you have my approval to terminate Lykos 
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 2:55 PM	Yes	Okay
+17344782101	May 27, 2014, 11:39 AM	Yes	When you get a chance withdraw half the money in the account, we need to close it before we pay the fee, which will be in the next couple days
+13367458849	May 27, 2014, 11:40 AM	No	okay I will, are you going to get your cousin to close the account? 
+17344782101	May 27, 2014, 11:40 AM	Yes	Yeah

+13367458849	May 27, 2014, 5:12 PM	No	alright

+13367458849	Jul 2, 2014, 5:48 PM	No	yeah why?
+17344782101	Jul 2, 2014, 5:49 PM	Yes	I need you to sign the dissolution agreement, it's a standard document I purchased from legalzoom, and does nothing other than dissolve the company
+13367458849	Jul 2, 2014, 5:49 PM	No	alright
+17344782101	Jul 7, 2014, 11:56 AM	Yes	Are you going to be home around 230?
+13367458849	Jul 7, 2014, 11:55 AM	No	yeah I will
+17344782101	Jul 7, 2014, 11:57 AM	Yes	Sweet, I'll be by with the docs
+13367458849	Jul 7, 2014, 12:00 PM	No	alright sounds good
+17344782101	Jul 7, 2014, 1:59 PM	Yes	I'm here
+17344782101	Jul 31, 2014, 3:08 PM	Yes	Hey when you set up iAd and banking info did we put my name on anything? And if so could you change it to not be on there?
+13367458849	Jul 31, 2014, 3:09 PM	No	nothing is on your name anymore 
+17344782101	Jul 31, 2014, 3:09 PM	Yes	Sweet
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	When are we leaving Wednesday for Raleigh?
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:15 PM	Yes	Probably around 4 o clock from school, we need to figure out who all is riding with me and you need to get written permission to Nesbit for you to drive back with me so that I don't have to be alone
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 9:41 PM	No	Ok I'll get that done
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	Thanks too
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	Dude my stickers are gunna blow haha
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 9:48 PM	Yes	They better not
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	I don't think Russell from up will really work. I don't really look like Russell any more I feel like
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:00 PM	Yes	Where the fuck is the Russell?
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	Yeah that may not work out...
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:00 PM	Yes	You just lost my vote
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 11:02 PM	No	Hahaha. The thing is people don't already know the comparison and idk if people would get it even if our pictures were side by side. I'm not sure if I really still look that much like Russell. I feel like I look to old as gay as that sounds
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:10 PM	Yes	If you keep talking I am going to become an advocate for your competitor, you have two days to procure me some Russell stickers, work quickly
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	Haha fuck you Connor
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	Seriously man I need you. Don't do this to me
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:12 PM	Yes	Don't do this to me
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	Do you want me to make a sheet of stickers specially for you?
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:19 PM	Yes	I would like that
+13366089023	Feb 3, 2014, 11:21 PM	No	Maybe
+17344782101	Feb 3, 2014, 11:28 PM	Yes	You will do that

+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 6:47 PM	Yes	I don't know
+13366089023	Feb 12, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	Ok. We need to get Winston yag/cona people to hang this weekend or something. I miss everyone
+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 6:57 PM	Yes	You sound very effeminate right now Overton
+13366089023	Feb 12, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	Haha, fuck you Connor.

+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 12:10 PM	Yes	Nope, we should probably get on that at some point
+13366089023	Feb 23, 2014, 12:12 PM	No	Yeah unfortunately I'm in college tours till Wednesday. What are you thinking about doing for proposals?
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 12:13 PM	Yes	Haven't even thought about it, any ideas?
+13366089023	Feb 23, 2014, 12:13 PM	No	Uhh not for you. I am thinking about doing something with foreign affairs but we can't do the same thing
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 12:15 PM	Yes	Foreign affairs is broad as hell Overton, care to be more specific? I am not going to steal your ideas by the way as they are probably way too left leaning for my tastes
+13366089023	Feb 23, 2014, 12:16 PM	No	Idk nuke Beijing or something maybe haha
+13366089023	Feb 23, 2014, 12:16 PM	No	If we both do something with the same general topic we would be in the same committee and that would be awesome
+13366089023	Feb 23, 2014, 12:16 PM	No	I'm not actually Nuking china 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 12:24 PM	Yes	We should do that, but you aren't really helping me by not telling me what you are doing
+13366089023	Feb 23, 2014, 12:43 PM	No	That's because I don't know what I'm doing yet. 
+17344782101	Feb 23, 2014, 12:56 PM	Yes	You are just useless aren't ya
+13366089023	Feb 23, 2014, 12:57 PM	No	I mean pretty much yeah
+13366089023	Feb 28, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Are you going to ziggy's?

+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:35 PM	Yes	I'm not the lieutenant governor rustle, my spot is on the line
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 8:35 PM	Yes	Give me topic ideas

+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:49 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:49 PM	Yes	Which of these is the most interesting? Just drafts still need to be rephrased
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:58 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 9:58 PM	Yes	Damnit Michael respond

+13366089023	Feb 28, 2014, 10:01 PM	No	I like the third one and I think it could go far if you make a good presentation. The first two are also solid, but I feel like a lot of people will do an eliminating tax loopholes proposal
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 10:10 PM	Yes	That's what I'm feeling, the third one is kind of joke though, you think that's alright?
+13366089023	Feb 28, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	Yes I do
+17344782101	Feb 28, 2014, 10:14 PM	Yes	Sweet

+13366089023	Mar 2, 2014, 12:13 AM	No	Ah gotcha, it wasn't due till today though right?
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 12:54 AM	Yes	Not sure, doesn't really matter for you, you are the lieutenant gov, you are already in
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 5:49 PM	Yes	Are you here yet?
+13366089023	Mar 2, 2014, 5:49 PM	No	Uh no it starts at 6 right?
+17344782101	Mar 2, 2014, 5:50 PM	Yes	Yeah but get your ass over here I left way too early
+13366089023	Mar 4, 2014, 6:55 PM	No	You are going to cona

+13366089023	Mar 4, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	Luke, ben, and Sidney 
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 7:11 PM	Yes	Not luke, knew she couldn't say no to him, Jonathan
+13366089023	Mar 4, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	You are surprised Jonathan is coming back?
+13366089023	Mar 4, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	Actually I could kinda see that
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 7:16 PM	Yes	Does he do anything?
+13366089023	Mar 4, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	He was a floor leader. I feel like is as involved as you can be without being a state officer
+13366089023	Mar 4, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	Jacob Jung got in
+17344782101	Mar 4, 2014, 7:46 PM	Yes	That's good
+13366089023	Mar 8, 2014, 3:30 PM	No	When do y'all go to the dr?

+13366089023	Mar 8, 2014, 3:34 PM	No	Ah nice! You excited?
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 3:50 PM	Yes	Hell yes, in less than 24 hours I'm going to be hammered on a beach
+13366089023	Mar 13, 2014, 5:45 PM	No	When do you have that Vanderbilt thing?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 5:46 PM	Yes	I am here now
+13366089023	Mar 13, 2014, 5:47 PM	No	Ah nice. Yeah I visited yesterday. I loved it. 
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 5:48 PM	Yes	It's nice, there are so many black kids at this thing man
+13366089023	Mar 13, 2014, 5:49 PM	No	Oh haha, is that a negative for your opinion of the school?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 5:51 PM	Yes	No, I'm just talking about this particular program
+13366089023	Mar 13, 2014, 5:52 PM	No	Yeah I know I'm just fucking with you. How big of a chance is there that you would go to Vanderbilt?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 5:53 PM	Yes	I'll let you know in two weeks
+13366089023	Mar 13, 2014, 5:54 PM	No	Aight fair enough. It's probably one of my top choices at this point
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 6:27 PM	Yes	Sweet, if you get invited to mosaic do not leave spring break early to come, it is not worth it
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 1:59 PM	No	Did you see the CPT groups for cona?
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 2:03 PM	Yes	No why?
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 2:04 PM	Yes	She texted me and said she gave the kids that will need help
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 2:03 PM	No	Oh. Well she emailed them to us. Is Jonathan coby a junior or senior?
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 2:10 PM	Yes	Junior, my group sucks
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 2:10 PM	No	Dude that pisses me off then that he is a CPT leader and I'm not
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 2:11 PM	Yes	Get over yourself
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 2:12 PM	No	Oh fuck off. Seriously though, it's supposed to be experienced older people.

+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 2:15 PM	No	Actually no this makes sense. He is the most experienced from the triangle area

+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 5:50 PM	No	I really don't want to end the Cuban embargo
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 5:57 PM	Yes	What do you want to do? I'll fix it
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 5:58 PM	No	No I mean like completely change the topic of my proposal haha
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 5:58 PM	Yes	Yeah I know, tell me and I will go in and edit it on the page
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 6:00 PM	No	Oh shit hahaha? Aight. How long is this window for me to tell you? I don't really know what I want to change it to 
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 6:00 PM	Yes	The sooner the better, I would work on that now
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 6:00 PM	No	Ok
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 7:32 PM	Yes	You have anything yet man, you are taking forever 
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 7:34 PM	No	Actually I may just stick with what I'm doing
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 7:40 PM	Yes	You are one lazy fucker
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	Hahaha, yup
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	Hey can you help me with my secretary speech?
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 7:57 PM	Yes	Sure, secretary of what? Also you aren't going to be doing the Cuban embargo one, I think you have your prison rehab thing
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 7:58 PM	No	Oh fuck dude I don't want that. Why would I not have the embargo?
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 7:59 PM	No	What the fuck that is my third option 
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 7:59 PM	Yes	I fixed it
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 7:59 PM	No	How the hell would I have gotten that?
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 7:59 PM	No	Oh sweet thanks. 
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	"Did you just put ""end the Cuban embargo""?"
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 8:00 PM	Yes	No I just I de selected the other one and then highlighted end the Cuban embargo
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 8:02 PM	No	Ok awesome thank you. Does it look like anyone else has the same one?
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 8:02 PM	Yes	Yeah but I changed hers
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 8:03 PM	No	Hahaha, nice. Yag corruption at its finest. Thank you
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 8:03 PM	No	Who was it?
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 8:04 PM	Yes	Nicky, actually they didn't have that one picked for her anyway
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	Oh ok. Anyway though, I'm running for secretary of the student body. I'm trying to figure out how to start the speech
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 8:06 PM	Yes	Just be funny and not arrogant, and you will win, everyone already likes you
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	I guess. This isn't really going to be one where I can be funny. I may go with the normal relatively serious speech, my competition isn't too bad. Also mcbride is clamping down on not taking it serious 
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 8:37 PM	Yes	Humor wins high school elections, make it work
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 8:40 PM	No	
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 8:40 PM	No	I will say it rather sarcastically
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 9:32 PM	Yes	Sounds good, fix the grammar though it's atrocious
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	For writing yes, but not for speaking
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	It doesn't matter though because I sent it to mr. Mcbride and he told me to rework it and reminded me that this isn't stand up comedy
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 9:33 PM	No	How stupid is that
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 9:34 PM	Yes	Haha that is quite funny
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 9:35 PM	Yes	Taking these things a little too seriously
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 9:36 PM	No	Yeah fuck this dude.
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 9:37 PM	Yes	Honestly I've got nothing for you then, just write something really boring and do it in an accent
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 9:38 PM	No	
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 9:38 PM	No	Do you think this would still be kinda humorous while still passing mr. Mcbride's inspection?
+13366089023	Mar 17, 2014, 9:38 PM	No	What about this?
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 9:43 PM	Yes	Won't pass his inspection, based on the last rejection you won't get away with anything, even if you could subvert him it's like the joke would be too intellectually for the dumb asses at our school to understand
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 9:43 PM	Yes	Likely
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 9:43 PM	Yes	And intellectual
+13366089023	Mar 27, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	Stanford?
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:08 PM	Yes	Tomorrow
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:08 PM	Yes	As of now it looks like  going to wharton
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:08 PM	Yes	I'm
+13366089023	Mar 27, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	Nah go to vandy over upenn
+13366089023	Mar 27, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	I might end up going to vandy haha
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:17 PM	Yes	Haha wharton is one of the best schools for undergrad business in the country, I can't rationalize going to vandy instead
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:18 PM	Yes	Also admissions raped me this year man, wait listed at Harvard, columbia, and fucking duke!! Denied at princeton
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:18 PM	Yes	I didn't get in to fuckin duke man
+13366089023	Mar 27, 2014, 8:24 PM	No	Ah I'm sorry man. That's tough. Apparently duke only accepted 9% this year from regular decision which is insane. I wouldn't get down because of all that man. Waitlisted at Harvard and Columbia is very impressive itself. You will excel wherever you end up going
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:30 PM	Yes	Haha thanks but I'm good, obviously the results are not what I was hoping for, but I can't be upset about ending up at wharton
+13366089023	Mar 27, 2014, 8:34 PM	No	No that is a huge accomplishment. And honestly when you get to this top tier of schools it is just a crap shoot
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 8:52 PM	Yes	That's true to an extent, the shitty truth for me though is that I didn't try in high school and now in paying the price
+17344782101	Apr 1, 2014, 12:00 PM	Yes	I volunteered you to come to blue ridge next week, we will leave Thursday afternoon and come back Saturday
+17344782101	Apr 1, 2014, 12:01 PM	Yes	Let me know right now if that doesn't work for you
+13366089023	Apr 1, 2014, 1:09 PM	No	Did you tell Shelley I was going?
+17344782101	Apr 1, 2014, 1:10 PM	Yes	Yeah
+17344782101	Apr 1, 2014, 1:10 PM	Yes	No not really
+13366089023	Apr 1, 2014, 1:10 PM	No	What?
+13366089023	Apr 1, 2014, 1:10 PM	No	Does she think I am going or does she not?
+17344782101	Apr 1, 2014, 1:10 PM	Yes	I told her you might, now I'll tell her you can
+13366089023	Apr 1, 2014, 1:10 PM	No	No
+13366089023	Apr 1, 2014, 1:10 PM	No	I can't
+17344782101	Apr 1, 2014, 1:11 PM	Yes	That's what I said, can
+13366089023	Apr 1, 2014, 1:11 PM	No	Cannot!
+17344782101	Apr 1, 2014, 1:11 PM	Yes	Yeah I know, can
+13366089023	Apr 1, 2014, 1:11 PM	No	Asshole
+17344782101	Apr 1, 2014, 1:12 PM	Yes	Your so cute russle
+13366089023	Apr 1, 2014, 1:12 PM	No	Fuck you moneybags
+13366089023	Apr 1, 2014, 1:12 PM	No	And I'm pretty sure it's spelt russel
+13366089023	Apr 2, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	What at the requirements for membership mu alpha theta?
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 8:42 PM	Yes	B+ or higher over three semesters, and you have to be in a math above ha2
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 8:42 PM	Yes	Don't quote me on that though
+17344782101	Apr 11, 2014, 10:15 PM	Yes	Your missing out man
+13366089023	Apr 11, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	Well I need to take the act.and I couldn't miss the last few days of school. How has it been though?
+17344782101	Apr 11, 2014, 11:05 PM	Yes	It's been interesting, I'll tell you about it when I get back, they put me faith Tess Mary glen and Ben in a cabin, I'm the adult
+13366089023	Apr 12, 2014, 7:20 AM	No	Haha, that's awesome. Maybe I can come next year
+17344782101	Apr 12, 2014, 7:41 AM	Yes	Haha no, I said interesting, not worth attending
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 5:24 PM	No	
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 5:24 PM	No	Dude how the fuck do I respond to that? I don't want to be an asshole to this guy but at the same time I don't want to ignore Luke
+17344782101	Apr 13, 2014, 5:29 PM	Yes	Doing your job doesn't make you an asshole Overton, and Luke is in the right on this one, just tell the guy that public actions that may be associated with yag have to be appropriate
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 5:29 PM	No	Ugh fine. 
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 5:30 PM	No	By the way, how did last night go for you?
+17344782101	Apr 13, 2014, 5:31 PM	Yes	Not great, Corinne had a curfew, so I left what I was at to drop her off and was then asked not to come back, so I went home and watched suits, you?
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 5:35 PM	No	You were asked not to come back?
+17344782101	Apr 13, 2014, 5:36 PM	Yes	It wasn't anything personal, his parents were home and he didn't want people coming in and out of his house, he wouldn't let people leave either
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 5:45 PM	No	Oh gotcha. Well, I was at the dance till about nine then changed at my house and went to jackie Kniejski's house with about 35 people
+17344782101	Apr 13, 2014, 6:44 PM	Yes	Nice, you get any?
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 6:45 PM	No	Nah she was on her period and I'm pretty sure she had vomited by midnight hahaha
+17344782101	Apr 13, 2014, 6:52 PM	Yes	Haha excuses are for pussies man
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 6:51 PM	No	Hahaha, fuck you Connor. 
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	The whole thing turned into a shit show though. I think like 10 people vomited at somepoint
+17344782101	Apr 13, 2014, 7:34 PM	Yes	Sounds more like a vomit show
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 7:35 PM	No	You are so funny Connor.
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 7:35 PM	No	How do you do it?
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 7:35 PM	No	That is just sublime rhetorical humor. it astounds me
+17344782101	Apr 13, 2014, 8:14 PM	Yes	I'm going to forgive your sarcasm this once, don't do it again
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Hahaha
+17344782101	Apr 13, 2014, 8:29 PM	Yes	There will be devastating consequences
+17344782101	Apr 13, 2014, 8:29 PM	Yes	Including but not limited to loss of my friendship, and emotional pain
+13366089023	Apr 13, 2014, 8:32 PM	No	Hahaha, ok Connor
+13366089023	Apr 18, 2014, 11:21 AM	No	Did you hear anything about Shelley?
+17344782101	Apr 18, 2014, 11:24 AM	Yes	No why?
+13366089023	Apr 18, 2014, 11:24 AM	No	Nevermind
+17344782101	Apr 18, 2014, 11:24 AM	Yes	No, tell me
+13366089023	Apr 18, 2014, 11:25 AM	No	Ok well don't repeat this to anyone. Not even her. But apparently she may leave the Y soon according to an email Joel Schneider got from her
+17344782101	Apr 18, 2014, 11:26 AM	Yes	Why would she email Joel?
+13366089023	Apr 18, 2014, 11:27 AM	No	Well he emailed her about something for the national judicial conference and then she emailed him back saying she might not even be going to NJC because she is looking for a new job. 
+13366089023	Apr 18, 2014, 11:27 AM	No	Apparently Joel and her son are good friends also
+17344782101	Apr 18, 2014, 11:33 AM	Yes	Damn, yag is going to crash and burn man
+13366089023	Apr 18, 2014, 11:36 AM	No	If this is true then it really is not good
+17344782101	Apr 18, 2014, 11:40 AM	Yes	Yeah your fucked man
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 7:04 PM	Yes	When are proposals due due
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 7:15 PM	No	Like the 12th I think 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 7:45 PM	Yes	Find out
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 7:47 PM	No	What? Dude you can find out yourself. You are a CPT leader you should be telling me
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 8:02 PM	Yes	Haha I know, I was just messing with ya
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	Connor I am so fucked for my math 2 subject test tomorrow 
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 9:22 PM	Yes	You'll be fine, also don't make the mistake I did, focus on your passions, that is what will get you where you want to go
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 9:23 PM	No	What do you mean?
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	How important are the subject tests for colleges?
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 9:36 PM	Yes	You have to do them, and you have to break 700, but like I said, you need to get more involved in what your passionate about, it is an election year I suggest you involve yourself very heavily in that
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 9:38 PM	No	Ok. When did you do the subject tests and did you have to do them a second time? I feel like I am going to need to do the math one twice if I want to break 700 but I don't know when I will be able to take it. I want to do the SAT in June and probably October
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 9:38 PM	No	And yeah I may end up doing something with elections that would be awesome
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 9:46 PM	Yes	I took them now once, and was fine, and yeah do that
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 9:47 PM	No	Ok I don't know what I'm going to do if I don't get a good score
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 10:09 PM	Yes	Cry about your life being over?
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 10:09 PM	No	Oh fuck off. I just don't know if I will be able to take it again
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 10:34 PM	Yes	You'll be fine
+13366089023	May 2, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	How many subject tests did you take?
+17344782101	May 2, 2014, 10:36 PM	Yes	Physics 800, math 750, history 640, only sent the two
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 5:49 PM	Yes	If you didn't put me down as your cona roommate preference I am going to run your testicles through a shredder
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 5:51 PM	No	Haha, don't worry I did
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 5:51 PM	Yes	Haha thank god, you are the best
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 5:52 PM	No	You better have out me
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 5:52 PM	No	Put*
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 5:53 PM	Yes	
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 5:53 PM	No	Haha, damn straight 
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 5:54 PM	No	I put victor Agbafe actually
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 5:54 PM	Yes	I put a threesome with Vic and Luke
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 5:55 PM	Yes	Did you like my goal and question segment?
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 5:55 PM	No	Haha, perfect. I didn't actually do those do I need to?
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 5:55 PM	Yes	No, time to write my proposal
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 6:01 PM	Yes	Which I'm going to send to you for review in a minute here
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 6:13 PM	No	Ok no problem
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 6:38 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 6:39 PM	Yes	Thanks
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	Definitely your laziness
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 6:40 PM	Yes	Yeah...
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 6:40 PM	No	Idk dude I think you should probably add at least some justification
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 6:43 PM	Yes	The thing is, and I mean this in a serious way, I want people to read my entire proposal, and those two fragments reiterate some of the points I'll make in my speech, does that make my short justification more acceptable or no?
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 6:52 PM	Yes	Do you think Luke would like it?
+13366089023	May 12, 2014, 7:13 PM	No	You should ask him
+17344782101	May 12, 2014, 7:22 PM	Yes	That was sarcasm, submitted!
+13366089023	May 18, 2014, 1:55 PM	No	Dude, riding back from a YAG event without you is so strange
+13366089023	May 18, 2014, 1:55 PM	No	I don't like it
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 2:01 PM	Yes	You might have to ride back from cona without me too
+13366089023	May 18, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	Noooo
+13366089023	May 18, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	Why?
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 2:03 PM	Yes	Because for some dumb reason they thought it was a good idea for us to leave in the fourth and I want to go be with my family
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 2:03 PM	Yes	On
+13366089023	May 18, 2014, 2:03 PM	No	Well ok. We will have the whole week though. Me and pierce yesterday were talking about how we are going to miss you, Lauren, and chase the most 
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 2:15 PM	Yes	*me the most, Lauren and chase can be a close third
+13366089023	May 18, 2014, 2:16 PM	No	Probably you, then Lauren, then chase actually
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 2:18 PM	Yes	Awe thanks, how'd the weekend go? Was it awkward with Shelley?
+13366089023	May 18, 2014, 2:33 PM	No	It went pretty well I think. And no it wasn't awkward with Shelley, but that's probably because she wasn't actually there. There were no adults there at all

+17344781253	Oct 18, 2014, 2:41 AM	No	Drunk brother, you're supes helpful. Go pis on some benches, hope she sits on those benches, and then wallow in self pity. Or, you can just get over her because you're not going to mate with her and have indecisive babies. You're not meant to be with someone who doesn't love you so why waste you're time with her. Bruh I love you and I know your heart is broken, but there will be other girls that you are actually meant to be with. Also shelb is way to smarticle for you.
+17344781253	Oct 18, 2014, 2:55 AM	No	Also I'm missing the last home football game of the season to visit you. Mickey and Bryan were like who the hell is gonna yell pick up lines at us during the game?

+17344782101	Oct 20, 2014, 10:20 PM	Yes	Grill I understand that, but it doesn't mean I'm not going to enjoy college just so that they can feel good. If my issues were anywhere near the level of those two I would seek help, but there not, and right now I don't need help
+17344781253	Oct 20, 2014, 10:21 PM	No	Haha I'm not saying don't have a good time, I'm saying don't tell them every single detail, tell me.

+17344781253	Oct 21, 2014, 1:22 PM	No	Yas I was think of buying stocks from coke because their stocks are rising in their usual pattern and they're fairly cheap right now
+17344782101	Oct 21, 2014, 1:28 PM	Yes	I would just recommend buying index funds grill, you aren't gonna beat the market because you don't have access to information quickly enough for a competitive advantage, that being said if your just looking to experiment pick whatever you want, just make sure you think it's undervalued
+17344781253	Oct 21, 2014, 1:29 PM	No	Aight I just wanna win, because if you're not first you're last. I'm also the only girl in investment club.

+17344782101	Oct 21, 2014, 9:51 PM	Yes	If you want to go the legit route, buy TNA and RUSL
+17344781253	Oct 21, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	What is short it?
+17344782101	Oct 21, 2014, 9:53 PM	Yes	Shorting is selling shares that you don't own, and then buying them to cover later. It's a bet that the price of the equity will go down 
+17344781253	Oct 21, 2014, 9:53 PM	No	Sounds complicated
+17344782101	Oct 21, 2014, 10:03 PM	Yes	Nah

+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 10:38 PM	Yes	Of course!

+19104480585	Feb 11, 2014, 11:46 PM	No	Ill keep my fingers crossed!
+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:47 PM	Yes	Thanks

+17344782101	Feb 11, 2014, 11:59 PM	Yes	Haha I enjoyed the whole thing, it really has been fantastic, thank you, and I will tell them
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	
	Mar 12, 2014, 8:24 PM	Yes	Hey, I'm good, you? just got back from the Dominican Republic, so I apologize if I'm responding to a message you sent a while ago
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 8:25 PM	No	Ah! Where in?! That's so fun
	Mar 12, 2014, 8:27 PM	Yes	Punta Cana, and it was fantastic, free alcohol, perfect weather, beaches, everything you need
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 8:29 PM	No	That was an hour away from where I was this summer! Did ya love it? And did you meet a Dominican named tato? He works in a bar in punta Cana
	Mar 12, 2014, 8:30 PM	Yes	I did, and no, I didn't leave my resort, when is y'all's spring break?
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	Aw bummer. And it's around Easter but I don't think I'm going anywhere :/ why?
	Mar 12, 2014, 8:33 PM	Yes	Just curious, you mentioned something in group me about a scholarship weekend at duke? Congrats! and what are you up for?
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	Thanks! It's the b.n. Duke scholarship which = full ride including room board and tuition plus two summer travel experiences. I'm pretty damn nervous about it
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	Btw where else did you apply?
	Mar 12, 2014, 8:39 PM	Yes	That's awesome! You'll be fine, and everywhere you'd think I would, I am actually headed to vandy for a muticultural student thing now
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 8:40 PM	No	Nice! What's that for? And I'm guessing that means you got accepted? 
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 8:40 PM	No	Also did you apply to Washington univ. In St. Louis?
	Mar 12, 2014, 8:50 PM	Yes	It's them trying to convince me to come, and yes, and no I didn't apply there why?
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 8:53 PM	No	Oh I gotchya, well congrats! And I was gonna say they just sent out their acceptances, thought you may have applied so I figured I'd tell ya! Where's your top choice?
	Mar 12, 2014, 8:56 PM	Yes	Congrats, I am assuming you got in? And stanford, but vandy was a huge relief because it was one of the ones I really didn't think id get into because they have a bad history with regular decision applicants from my school
	Mar 12, 2014, 8:56 PM	Yes	And I think I'd be happy there if nothing else pans out
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	Yep! But you're a genius and better than 99% of their applicant pool so you had no need to be worried, silly Connor
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 9:03 PM	No	Haha but congrats on that acceptance!! When do you hear back from the rest? April 1?
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 9:24 PM	Yes	I think everything will actually come out on the 27th, everyone typically releases on the Friday before the deadline
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	Oh okay well thanks for the info haha! Btw do you have any idea why this isn't showing up as iMessage?
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	Nevermind...it just did
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 9:27 PM	Yes	I was wondering the same thing actually, it might have been because my data was still turned off
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Oh haha okay I thought it may be my phone since it's new, but of course when I asked it went back. 
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 9:51 PM	Yes	I'm feeling very validated about putting Mexican on my apps, a random Spanish speaking guy came up to me for help in the airport assuming I knew Spanish
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 9:52 PM	No	Hahaha what a win, idk I feel like you are much more legitimate than I am
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 10:04 PM	Yes	Ali I am obviously more legitimate than you
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 10:09 PM	Yes	Yeah if they make me dance they are going to think I'm white
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	Hahaha I'm going to sign you up for classes or something. Oh and the scholarship weekend overlaps with when the new exec officers have their first training session :((
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	But both sessions get done on sat so maybe we could all meet up??
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 10:14 PM	Yes	That's unfortunate, and yeah we should do that, it is miserably cold here and I hate it
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 10:14 PM	No	Really?! It's been beach weather here the past week--- looks like a great excuse to come visit Wilmington! 
+17344782101	Mar 12, 2014, 10:19 PM	Yes	Yeah it was beach weather in punta Cana too, maybe
+19104480585	Mar 12, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	Who'd you go with? 
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 12:06 AM	Yes	A bunch of my friends from school, it was a class trip kind of thing
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 8:15 AM	No	That's awesome- no one at my school ever can do that kinda thing
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 11:02 AM	Yes	It was a lot of fun, really regretting leaving early at the moment, this vandy thing isn't looking like it's going to be all the that great
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 11:13 AM	No	I'm sorry :/ were you guys down there without parents?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 11:31 AM	Yes	There were parents, but they were all hammered the whole time
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 11:52 AM	No	Oh haha so technically no. Did your gf come? How's that going?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 12:07 PM	Yes	No, and I actually broke up with her right before the trip
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 12:14 PM	No	Oh...I'm sorry for bringing it up 
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 1:34 PM	Yes	No it's fine, I broke up with her so I could not worry in the dr
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 1:35 PM	No	Hahaha oo playa playa
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 1:35 PM	No	I'm guessing the relationship wasn't that serious then?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 2:51 PM	Yes	It was getting too serious actually, and yeah
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 3:50 PM	No	That confuses me...what does that mean? Are you saying she was getting too serious of feelings? 
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 3:53 PM	Yes	As in I'm not sure she realized that there was no way we were staying together in college
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 3:56 PM	No	Ohhhhhh okay completely understand now- yeah that's my issue. The guy I was talking to didn't get that I didn't want to date anyone nor be with someone in college
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 3:56 PM	No	But it still kinda is shitty to end things 
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 4:02 PM	Yes	I agree, it was an asshole move, but I think it was better than cheating on her in the dr would have been
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	I mean I wouldn't say asshole move, I just think it's the mature move but not exactly pleasant for either party. Plus it was especially a good move because I've never understood cheating- call it naive- but I feel like if you feel like cheating just break up with the person, so many less hurt feelings and less drama. 
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 4:17 PM	No	But then again I'm biased because I've been cheated on so idk
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 5:10 PM	Yes	I don't know, I mean she knew that I was breaking up with her for that reason so it made it kind of awkward
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 6:17 PM	No	Oh....wellllll yeah I agree that's a bit awkward. You didn't hook up with one of her friends in the Dominican right?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 6:18 PM	Yes	No, not with one of her friends
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 6:19 PM	No	Oh okay then that's fine
+19104480585	Mar 13, 2014, 6:19 PM	No	Are you guys still friends?
+19104480585	Mar 28, 2014, 12:55 PM	No	Hey! Any good news?
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 1:00 PM	Yes	I got into wharton at penn! But wait listed at Harvard, columbia and duke, stanford is later today, congrats! I heard you had great results
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 1:00 PM	Yes	I got in a couple other places but I'm probably going to wharton
+19104480585	Mar 28, 2014, 1:01 PM	No	Ahhhh congrats!!! And yeah I got into Columbia!!! 
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 1:02 PM	Yes	That's awesome!
+19104480585	Mar 28, 2014, 1:01 PM	No	Btw good luck! Keep me updated on the results!
+19104480585	Mar 28, 2014, 1:01 PM	No	And thanks Connor!
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 1:04 PM	Yes	Will do, you think columbia is where you'll end up or are you waiting on any one else?
+19104480585	Mar 28, 2014, 1:52 PM	No	Not waiting on anyone else- as of right now if I get the full ride to duke I'm going there, and if not I'm going to Columbia
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 4:03 PM	Yes	Well congrats, those are both fantastic outcomes
+19104480585	Mar 28, 2014, 4:09 PM	No	Thanks Connor! You options are pretty amazing as well
+19104480585	Mar 28, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 9:41 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, but only cause we are the shit
+19104480585	Mar 29, 2014, 12:28 AM	No	Hahahha we had reasons- I definitely went through withdrawal when people no longer clapped for me when I walked in a room 
+17344782101	Mar 29, 2014, 12:45 AM	Yes	Haha yeah people still do for me actually
+19104480585	Mar 29, 2014, 12:58 AM	No	Hahaha oh do they really now? Probs because your entire school participates in yag
+17344782101	Mar 29, 2014, 1:16 AM	Yes	Haha nah not really, but yeah, thanks to good old Nesbit, so when am I going to see you/everyone again? I've heard no talk of reunions or get togethers
+19104480585	Mar 29, 2014, 1:17 AM	No	I knowwww it sucks. Uh well I'll totally come up to Winston if you guys have a concert one night and ya let me know, or I mean no joke you are always free to come down here on a free weekend- we can try to figure out when people have one!
+19104480585	Apr 15, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	hey!! How was blue ridge?! I'm so jealous
+17344782101	Apr 16, 2014, 7:45 AM	Yes	Hey :) it was alright, middle schoolers were driving me crazy by the end though
+19104480585	Apr 16, 2014, 7:46 AM	No	Ew it was middle schoolers? Regardless you got to see faith!! Was anyone else there from yag? She's the only one Shelley told me was going
+17344782101	Apr 16, 2014, 8:43 AM	Yes	Tess and mg, and yeah they were quite annoying 
+17344782101	Apr 16, 2014, 8:43 AM	Yes	The middle schoolers, not Tess and mg
+19104480585	Apr 16, 2014, 8:44 AM	No	HAHA I was about to say...uhhhhhh okay Connor, guess someone is in a pessimistic mood
+17344782101	Apr 16, 2014, 8:49 AM	Yes	Haha no, I'm in a great mood because I got 12 hours of sleep last night
+19104480585	Apr 16, 2014, 8:50 AM	No	Hahaha damn, I'm on  spring break and getting less sleep- screw you. What did you guys do at blue ridge?? Any fun officer stuff or dinners or whatnot
+17344782101	Apr 16, 2014, 10:01 AM	Yes	Haha yeah but your on spring break, so screw you, and we didn't really do much of anything to be honest, how'd the scholarship weekend go?
+19104480585	Apr 16, 2014, 10:09 AM	No	Aw really??? And I got it!!! So I'm going to duke now haha- what about you have you made a decision?

+19104480585	Apr 16, 2014, 10:56 AM	No	Okay one of my best guy friends is also going, and he's super sarcastic and sings and plays guitar- you guys would either get along really well or not at all. Butttt I want you to meet him if you're ever in Wilmington (my bet is you would like him)
+17344782101	Apr 16, 2014, 12:59 PM	Yes	Haha alright, well I was hoping to get out that direction at some point this summer anyway, so maybe that'll work out, whered you go for break? Or are you just throwin down in Wilmington?

+17344782101	Jul 8, 2014, 10:52 PM	Yes	Haha yes, I do, and haha he wasn't a lucky break, I'm just good at identifying talent, are you drunk?

+17344782101	Jul 8, 2014, 11:24 PM	Yes	I'm not sure :/ a trip to the coast is hard to swing, but on the bright side one to duke is much more feasible
+19104480585	Jul 8, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	Truuuuu do you think you'd be able to swing it with your schedule 
+17344782101	Jul 8, 2014, 11:31 PM	Yes	Probably not to the coast, I'm actually going out of town for much of what's left of the summer, but as of now it's looking like I'll only have one morning class on Fridays so coming back to nc for weekend trips should be pretty doable
+19104480585	Jul 8, 2014, 11:32 PM	No	Sweet do it
+19104480585	Jul 8, 2014, 11:32 PM	No	I don't have class on Fridays

+17344782101	Feb 6, 2014, 3:51 PM	Yes	Is the app being updated then? Because nothing's changed
+12526717629	Feb 6, 2014, 3:53 PM	No	It will be shortly. After the second round of bills go through

+12526717629	Feb 7, 2014, 10:22 AM	No	Is now. Everything is good, it just lags behind because of the bills not being notified instantly 
+12526717629	Feb 7, 2014, 10:22 AM	No	Like, its updated whenever the bills reach the bill office

+19198303671	Jul 28, 2014, 2:08 PM	No	What are some of those investment books you were talking about?
+17344782101	Jul 28, 2014, 6:06 PM	Yes	I don't remember specifically, but anything by any of the big names, Jeremy Siegel, Warren Buffet, etc. would be beneficial
+19198303671	Jul 28, 2014, 6:21 PM	No	Got it, thanks man. 
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 7:30 PM	Yes	Did you see playboy's party school rankings?
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 7:30 PM	No	That I did not

+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	I can't apply to penn unless I take sat subject tests
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	Which I have none of at the moment
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 7:39 PM	Yes	You should get on it, wharton is where you belong
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	Yeah I'm doing what I can
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	Yale may be my best though, my grandpas former assistant from Nasdaq is the head of the endowment there
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 7:45 PM	Yes	Yale isn't ED though so applying early doesn't really make a difference, apply based on where you want to go, not best shot
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 7:45 PM	No	This is true. Upenn is definitely the best choice major wise 
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 7:45 PM	No	I need to find two subject tests I can destroy
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 8:32 PM	Yes	All around it's definitely the best choice, and you should probably take math and something
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 8:32 PM	Yes	How's yag going?
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	I feel that. And yeah I'll look into it
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	And well we are redoing alot actually
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	I'm so glad Joseph exists to keep the Secretary of State on track. Ali honestly kind of screwed up there in my opinion
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 8:34 PM	Yes	He's my greatest contribution
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 8:34 PM	No	We are having gov and lt gov primaries in each region as well as PO elections within regions
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 9:01 PM	Yes	Interesting, seems like a lot of work though
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	Hell yeah it is. 
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 9:10 PM	Yes	Haha why work though? Also how's the new head?
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 9:11 PM	No	Because the head decided this is how it's going to be done
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 9:11 PM	No	And well I haven't met her yet
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 10:09 PM	No	Yeah upenn 25% acceptance rate for early decision 
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 10:09 PM	No	Even though children of alumni get preference of course
+17344782101	Sep 15, 2014, 10:13 PM	Yes	Yeah it's more like 9 for wharton though, keep that in mind
+19198303671	Sep 15, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	That's true. God man, it's stressful. Cuz early decision is binding etc. 
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 11:58 AM	Yes	Yeah, definitely don't do it if it's not your first choice, but if you think it might be ed is the way to go, huge advantage and there is nothing better then being done with the admissions processs
+19198303671	Sep 16, 2014, 12:34 PM	No	Either way, I'm gonna probably need your help with answering the essay. 
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 12:52 PM	Yes	No problem, just send any questions over as they come up, any chance your going to be able to visit the campus?
+19198303671	Sep 16, 2014, 2:37 PM	No	That's a very real possibility that I'll have to look into, just for dates etc. my dad is very pro me visiting everywhere I want to go to so that helps. 
+19198303671	Sep 16, 2014, 2:37 PM	No	
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 10:22 PM	Yes	Sweet, and haha of course, it'll be fun
+19198303671	Sep 27, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	Hey man when would the best time for me to visit be?
+17344782101	Sep 27, 2014, 7:10 PM	Yes	I'm pretty flexible, just let me know dates that work for you and we'll work from there
+19198303671	Sep 27, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	Okay then. It'll probably be a weekend or something like that, I'll get back to you. 
+17344782101	Sep 27, 2014, 7:17 PM	Yes	Sounds good, just don't book travel arrangements until you check in
+19198303671	Sep 27, 2014, 7:18 PM	No	I won't, you'll know when I'm coming I won't just show up at your dorm with a pillow pet and sleeping bag
+17344782101	Sep 27, 2014, 7:20 PM	Yes	Haha I'd be totally cool with it if you did, I'm just going to be out of town periodically over the next couple months and I want to make sure Ill be here
+19198303671	Sep 27, 2014, 7:20 PM	No	Ahhh I got you I got you. Sounds good man, thanks again. I got a 33 on my act by the way, so I'm using those over my sat
+17344782101	Sep 27, 2014, 7:23 PM	Yes	That's awesome man, between that and gov shit you should have a pretty solid shot
+19198303671	Sep 27, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	Lets hope so. I'm gonna talk to when I write my essay, because it asks why I'm a good fit for Wharton and 
+19198303671	Sep 27, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	I need some insider information onwharton so I can better answer it
+17344782101	Sep 27, 2014, 7:25 PM	Yes	Haha sounds good
+19198303671	Sep 29, 2014, 7:15 PM	No	Okay I'm trying to get to upenn before the early decision is due, and I have a trip to Yale planned the 16-18. Then yag blocks the rest  of the month after that. So essentially I have this weekend and next weekend open, what is better for you, if either are possible.
+17344782101	Sep 29, 2014, 7:21 PM	Yes	I think either would be fine, what days would you come up? And what all are you trying to do while your here? Cause next weekend is fall break so you wouldn't be able to go to any classes
+17344782101	Sep 29, 2014, 7:22 PM	Yes	Also this weekend and next might be kind of quiet because of some Jewish holiday, and then the break
+19198303671	Sep 29, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	I think getting to see a class would be great, so it seems I'll come this weekend. I'd probably drive up on Friday (my dad might be driving up too but he is gonna just wander around Philly) and I'd spend the night at a hotel or something if I can't make it all the way up in a day. Then meet you early ish Saturday and go from there. Will be classes Monday? Because that'd be the best time for me to go if possible
+17344782101	Sep 29, 2014, 7:36 PM	Yes	Fall break is actually Thursday Friday, so you're good for Monday classes either way. And next weekend might be better, turns out campus will be completely dead this weekend
+19198303671	Sep 29, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	
+17344782101	Sep 29, 2014, 7:49 PM	Yes	Haha I'm not sure that's what they meant
+19198303671	Sep 29, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	Well they had like an alum/family thing and then it asked what's a way you heard about upenn etc and an option was a friend haha
+19198303671	Oct 2, 2014, 7:34 PM	No	Just to confirm (for my dad) not this weekend but the next is when I'll be coming up correct?
+17344782101	Oct 11, 2014, 7:18 AM	Yes	So my flight lands in philly around noon, and I should be back on campus by 1230ish
+17344782101	Oct 11, 2014, 7:24 AM	Yes	Actually probably closer to 1ish
+19198303671	Oct 11, 2014, 8:16 AM	No	Sounds good man, we may be getting to airport at the same time haha. We rented a car so that's where are going to be dropping it off. 
+17344782101	Oct 11, 2014, 8:29 AM	Yes	Haha alright, let me know, are you taking septa from the airport to campus then?
+19198303671	Oct 11, 2014, 8:32 AM	No	If that's a train, then yes I believe so. 
+17344782101	Oct 11, 2014, 8:54 AM	Yes	Haha it is, I'll probably be on the 1230ish train so just let me know where you're at
+19198303671	Oct 11, 2014, 9:15 AM	No	Will do my friend. 
+17344782101	Oct 11, 2014, 10:22 AM	Yes	Just a head up its looking like my flight is going to end up being pretty delayed
+19198303671	Oct 11, 2014, 10:26 AM	No	Okay then, any idea what time that's gonna be?
+19198303671	Oct 11, 2014, 10:34 AM	No	It's not a big deal at all really, I got college essays to write haha
+17344782101	Oct 11, 2014, 10:41 AM	Yes	Unfortunately no, already on the plane about to takeoff and there was an equipment malfunction, hopefully not more than an hour or two, but there is a chance that the flight ends up being canceled. In which case it will probably be quite a bit
+19198303671	Oct 11, 2014, 11:19 AM	No	That'd be quite the bitch. Iight well just keep me updated, hope everything works out
+17344782101	Oct 11, 2014, 11:45 AM	Yes	Will do, thanks
+17344782101	Oct 11, 2014, 12:36 PM	Yes	Should be taking off in a minute here
+19198303671	Oct 11, 2014, 12:44 PM	No	Awesome 
+17344782101	Oct 11, 2014, 12:45 PM	Yes	Haha ehh, not when I should be landing

+13366959263	Feb 9, 2014, 1:02 AM	No	You party animal you
+17344782101	Feb 9, 2014, 1:04 AM	Yes	I'm falling asleep in a pile of people
+13366959263	Feb 9, 2014, 1:04 AM	No	I'm so jealous
+13366959263	Feb 9, 2014, 2:58 PM	No	Dude, I texted David and Evan about practice. They're pretty upset they hadn't been told earlier and they haven't been practicing the stuff because they thought we weren't playing the gig. I think you should apologize to them for the confusion, I'm not blaming you or anything but I think it would mean something I them if you tried to set it straight. Also, is 4 too early? cuz that's the time I gave them
+13366959263	Feb 9, 2014, 2:58 PM	No	Catherine and Daniel cannot come
+13366959263	Feb 9, 2014, 3:22 PM	No	Now they're saying even if we had practice later it wouldn't be enough time to be ready so they want to do a week day practice. I know you and Catherine will both be busy so idk how to work that out
+13366959263	Feb 9, 2014, 6:00 PM	No	Hey what's the date, time, etc for the event?
+13366959263	Feb 21, 2014, 6:55 PM	No	Jay has a ticket for you
+17344782101	Feb 21, 2014, 6:56 PM	Yes	Thanks, be there in ten
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	Double check with her to make sure she has coming I have asked too many times already
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	If not we still need to practice
+13366959263	Feb 22, 2014, 1:25 PM	No	Yeah agreed. Just thought I'd throw out the proposition because the guy teaching the workshop had played with and written for a ton of famous artists
+17344782101	Feb 22, 2014, 1:30 PM	Yes	I agree that it would be sweet but we really don't have enough time with Catherine 
+13366959263	Feb 22, 2014, 1:31 PM	No	I think so too
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:30 PM	Yes	Did you talk to Catherine/ confirm she was coming yet? 
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 9:47 PM	No	She hasn't responded yet
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 9:51 PM	Yes	Does she know how many people are going to be at this thing?
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 9:51 PM	No	I'll tell her
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:10 PM	Yes	It might be time to start thinking of girls that have good enough voices to come stand in for her, of course we would probably have to pay someone a significant amount to do that at this point which sucks, but may be our best option
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	Erin bacon? Your sister?
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 10:19 PM	No	I'm gonna tell the guys. Catherine's a no-go. Even if we convinced Truel (which we couldn't), Catherine would not do our gig because the chorus thing had priority (and rightly so if you ask me)
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 7:32 AM	Yes	
+13366959263	Feb 25, 2014, 7:43 AM	No	So you knew she couldn't come on the 18th?
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 7:48 AM	Yes	No she goes on to say she can come
+17344782101	Feb 25, 2014, 7:55 AM	Yes	She thought I meant last week at first
+13366959263	Feb 25, 2014, 8:07 AM	No	Oh I see.... Hmm
+13366959263	Feb 26, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	In case I get off on time, where is the building in which we're setting up?
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 4:47 PM	Yes	Could you possibly come at six and then leave at 7 so your there for the post game crowd?
+13366959263	Feb 26, 2014, 4:55 PM	No	I'll ask/strongly suggest it
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 5:04 PM	Yes	Yeah, none of us know how to put the kit back together
+17344782101	Feb 26, 2014, 6:19 PM	Yes	You need to get off, venue is much bigger than anyicipated and the majority of people will only be hearing you through the pa, none of us know how to set up your drums and the sounds check needs to be done tonight
+13366959263	Mar 27, 2014, 7:07 PM	No	Hey, you find out from anyone?

+13366959263	Mar 28, 2014, 12:43 AM	No	Hey dude, praying for you to get into Stanford. I believe you'll get in. Just wanted to encourage you to just make college God's responsibility. Let me know as soon as you find out
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 8:14 AM	Yes	I really appreciate that man, and will do
+13366959263	Mar 28, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	You coming to the mellow mush?
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 7:44 PM	Yes	I'm here, are you?
+13366959263	Mar 28, 2014, 7:44 PM	No	Yup
+13366959263	May 4, 2014, 8:52 PM	No	Hey, idk if you know anything about this but my parents are wondering if I have to pay to go to the baccalaureate at inmar
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 8:56 PM	Yes	The thing at inmar is after the baccalaureate, and there is a cost, but my mom is asleep so I won't be able to get you any details until tomorrow
+13366959263	May 4, 2014, 8:56 PM	No	Alright that's fine
+13366959263	May 4, 2014, 8:56 PM	No	Thanks man

+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 6:25 PM	Yes	My mom will be back from my brothers lacrosse game in a little bit, can you remind me to ask her in 45 minutes?
+13366959263	May 5, 2014, 6:34 PM	No	Will do

+13366959263	May 5, 2014, 8:27 PM	No	They did but I'm just wondering if I have to pay for myself as well. I know my family members do
+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 8:32 PM	Yes	Yes, you do
+13366959263	May 5, 2014, 8:32 PM	No	Alright, thanks man

+13366959263	May 26, 2014, 9:06 PM	No	Jk, she just wanted you to have her number. She didn't directly tell me she wanted your wood
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	Good, I am very glad to hear that those are your words, I've been waiting to hear them from you for four years, when do we start as male strippers by the way?

+13366959263	May 26, 2014, 11:58 PM	No	Haha same here

+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 1:07 AM	Yes	No, the airspace around okracoke is either restricted or used for military operations, it would take more planning and experience than I have time for before then
+13366959263	Jun 7, 2014, 1:07 AM	No	Darn 
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 1:07 AM	Yes	Sorry man

+13366959263	Jun 7, 2014, 1:08 AM	No	It's no problem, I would still be pressed for time anyways
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 1:09 AM	Yes	If you just wanna fly we might be able to figure something out toward the end of the summer, it'll be a while before I'm actually licensed
+13366959263	Jun 7, 2014, 1:13 AM	No	Are you able to fly at all before you're liscenced?
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 1:28 AM	Yes	Yeah, but I can't take passengers unless I'm with an instructor
+13366959263	Jun 7, 2014, 1:28 AM	No	Oh, cool
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 1:30 AM	Yes	Yeah, I'll probably do my first solo the week before or after beach week, which is kind of scary because I've only been able to land the plane without assistance once
+13366959263	Jun 7, 2014, 1:30 AM	No	I believe in you dude 
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 1:32 AM	Yes	I'll figure it out, and if not, I'll only do it wrong once

+13366959263	Jul 6, 2014, 1:40 PM	No	You and Megan gave me the same birthday card. Coincidence? I think not
+17344782101	Jul 6, 2014, 3:55 PM	Yes	Your right, we totally planned it
+13366959263	Jul 6, 2014, 4:06 PM	No	Figured you guys were still shopping together
+17344782101	Jul 6, 2014, 4:10 PM	Yes	Your absolutely right, what did you get on comparative?

+13366959263	Sep 3, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	I don't want it to be a hotness rating thing
+17344782101	Sep 3, 2014, 8:56 PM	Yes	I don't either, but he's clearly interested so giving a number to satisfy isn't a big deal
+13366959263	Sep 3, 2014, 8:59 PM	No	True
+13366959263	Sep 3, 2014, 8:59 PM	No	But the subject changed
+19103982566	Feb 8, 2014, 12:37 AM	No	Hey, you have no idea how much it made my day when you said I was 'gubernatorial'

+19103982566	Mar 16, 2014, 8:39 PM	No	And I'm not sure how to tell everyone 
+17344782101	Mar 16, 2014, 8:41 PM	Yes	First off, congrats, and second I say you just go for it, Everyone will be upset to see you go but if this is what you want then they will be happy for you
+17344782101	Mar 16, 2014, 8:42 PM	Yes	I would probably tell the people you are closest to individually and the rest in the group me
+19103982566	Mar 16, 2014, 8:43 PM	No	Yeah... 
+19103982566	Mar 16, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	It just seems like something I should say in person, but then I feel like I wouldn't be being upfront 
+17344782101	Mar 16, 2014, 8:49 PM	Yes	I'm assuming that the school isn't in nc? And I see why you feel that way, but sometimes the best thing to do with bad news is break it as quickly as possible, have you talked to Shelley?
+19103982566	Mar 16, 2014, 8:50 PM	No	
+19103982566	Mar 16, 2014, 8:50 PM	No	Haha she wrote me a  recommendation 
+17344782101	Mar 16, 2014, 8:51 PM	Yes	Haha that would make sense, is it one of the major Ivy League feeders?
+19103982566	Mar 16, 2014, 8:51 PM	No	You could say that 
+19103982566	Mar 16, 2014, 8:51 PM	No	Andover? 
+17344782101	Mar 16, 2014, 9:01 PM	Yes	It looks pretty impressive. tess everyone is going to be very happy for you, you are going to get the high school education and experience that I think most of us wish we could have received, ncyag is going to miss you, but this is what you deserve and everyone knows that, besides, everyone important is leaving this year anyway
+19103982566	Mar 16, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	Thanks! Well, yeah, but don't tell Pierce 
+17344782101	Mar 16, 2014, 9:04 PM	Yes	Haha I won't, your still coming to cona right?

+19103982566	Apr 7, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	Are you heading up to Blue Ridge at the same time as Shelley and MG and Faith?
+17344782101	Apr 7, 2014, 4:51 PM	Yes	I am, probably a little later though because I'm already missing almost the whole week of school for penn admit days
+19103982566	Apr 7, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	That's awesome! Are you gonna meet them in Raleigh? 
+19103982566	Apr 7, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	Cause I can get a ride up to Raleigh from Wilmy, but I think Shelley's car is filling up 
+17344782101	Apr 7, 2014, 4:59 PM	Yes	I wish I could help, but Raleigh would be a 3 hour detour for me
+19103982566	Apr 7, 2014, 4:58 PM	No	Yeah, I figured 
+19103982566	Apr 7, 2014, 4:58 PM	No	Thanks tho

+17344782101	Apr 15, 2014, 6:42 PM	Yes	Haha I'm glad you like it, it will probably be the only one I ever make, homemade crafts are not my jam
+19103982566	Apr 15, 2014, 6:48 PM	No	Don't give up your talent

+19103982566	May 10, 2014, 10:10 PM	No	There are jokes that I could make about that wording that I'm trying really hard not to make

+17344782101	Feb 12, 2014, 6:08 PM	Yes	Did the pp end up happening?
+13363914954	Feb 12, 2014, 6:08 PM	No	No pp
+13367458849	Feb 12, 2014, 6:08 PM	No	no

	Feb 15, 2014, 8:11 PM	Yes	Congratulations man! That's awesome
+13368314649	Feb 15, 2014, 8:22 PM	No	Thanks
+13368314649	Apr 12, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	There a party?
	Apr 12, 2014, 10:47 PM	Yes	I don't know yet, I have to take my date home in a little bit
+13368314649	Apr 12, 2014, 10:48 PM	No	K
	May 1, 2014, 8:15 PM	Yes	Any idea what's going on tonight?
+13368314649	May 1, 2014, 8:17 PM	No	No. I guess I can have a few people over if it come to that. AJ has most of my alcohol but I have a 750 ml bottle of bourbon and some Sam Adams
	May 1, 2014, 8:20 PM	Yes	I'm pretty sure that there are things happening so that probably won't be necessary, all the girls are getting together for dinner, and I heard we may all be doing something after, but I don't know any specifics
+13368314649	May 1, 2014, 8:56 PM	No	K
+13368314649	May 2, 2014, 10:30 PM	No	Anything going down tonight?
	May 2, 2014, 10:33 PM	Yes	No, I'm watching tv at jays but everyone is going home soon
+13368314649	May 2, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	Aight
	May 5, 2014, 6:24 PM	Yes	I know this is short notice, but I can go in Wednesday, Thursday afternoon, and Friday, will try to let you know as far in advance as possible, but it's hard to estimate how much time I'll need to spend studying
+13368314649	May 5, 2014, 6:51 PM	No	Okay that really only changes the Wednesday schedule. I will talk with the other guys and see if they want to do a half day on wednesday, as I am pretty sure most of us have an exam.
	May 5, 2014, 6:52 PM	Yes	Forgot about that, halfway works for me as well then, it might be nice to all start at the same time
+13368314649	May 5, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	Jay cavenaugh says no, Jay do says yes. That puts us at three out of five, still waiting for eric response
	May 5, 2014, 7:00 PM	Yes	Between lax and terrible time management skills jay c is going to be particularly difficult, if we get Eric I say we definitely go
+13368314649	May 5, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	Eric is good to go. I'll send joe an email about it.
+13368314649	May 5, 2014, 7:05 PM	No	And yeah, I say we don't bother jay about it,  cause it doesn't affect us a whole lot
	May 7, 2014, 10:19 AM	Yes	What time are we meeting at inmar?
+13368314649	May 7, 2014, 12:09 PM	No	Monte del rey
+13368314649	May 7, 2014, 12:09 PM	No	In lewisville
	May 7, 2014, 12:13 PM	Yes	Okay
	May 7, 2014, 12:28 PM	Yes	Are y'all still here?
	May 12, 2014, 8:08 PM	Yes	You almost here?
+13368314649	May 12, 2014, 8:09 PM	No	Yes
	May 12, 2014, 8:10 PM	Yes	It's open
+13368314649	May 12, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	Actually I'm here how do I get in
+13368314649	May 30, 2014, 8:43 PM	No	Is connor having fun yet?
	May 30, 2014, 8:57 PM	Yes	Connor is full on appetizers and waiting for his 42 oz steak entree, I'm pretty content, what about you?
+13368314649	May 30, 2014, 8:58 PM	No	Actually exactly the same. The Doughertys are Makin some steak
	May 30, 2014, 9:00 PM	Yes	Nice, bet it's not a 42 oz, any idea what's happening later?
+13368314649	May 30, 2014, 9:02 PM	No	Dude what is going on we are like the same person right now. Idk either. Hayden line burger is my contact which is good because he is really enthusiastic about this shit but bad because he doesn't have any contacts
	May 30, 2014, 9:08 PM	Yes	Crazy, and he'll probably figure it out, he's pretty persistent, I really don't think that anything is planned yet
	May 30, 2014, 9:09 PM	Yes	There's a big bv group dinner, it will probably be decided there
+13368314649	May 30, 2014, 9:47 PM	No	I would be game to have people at my mountain house, even though I doubt people would want to go that far
	May 30, 2014, 10:02 PM	Yes	Something will happen near here I just don't know what yet
+13368314649	May 30, 2014, 10:02 PM	No	K. Keep me posted if possible
	May 30, 2014, 10:06 PM	Yes	If I hear of anything I'll tell you
+13368314649	May 30, 2014, 11:39 PM	No	If you still aren't anywhere, we are headed back to my house to have some drinks
+13368314649	May 30, 2014, 11:39 PM	No	*and I want you to come if you wanna
	May 30, 2014, 11:40 PM	Yes	I'm headed to justin langs actually
+13368314649	May 30, 2014, 11:40 PM	No	K
+13368314649	Jun 6, 2014, 6:54 PM	No	Hey andreas wants the website code
+17344782101	Jun 6, 2014, 6:55 PM	Yes	I apologize I completely forgot about that, what's his email?
+13368314649	Jun 6, 2014, 6:56 PM	No	Just send it to me. Easier
+17344782101	Jun 6, 2014, 6:57 PM	Yes	You already have it actually
+17344782101	Jun 6, 2014, 6:58 PM	Yes	It's being hosted on Taptools
+13368314649	Jun 6, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	Can you... send it again? Un a zip?
+17344782101	Jun 6, 2014, 6:59 PM	Yes	Yeah, not until later tonight though, Eric also has a nice zipable copy if you need it sooner, did y'all decide to take the internship?
+13368314649	Jun 6, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	Yes. I think you are invited. Joe said that an offer would be out soon.
+13368314649	Jun 6, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	Personally, I want you on the project. I might give you half my cut if you will stay on. That's a definate might.
+17344782101	Jun 6, 2014, 7:15 PM	Yes	I want to take it, but I'm cutting my pilots license closer than I thought, ima be doing 4-6 hour days with that, and I don't know if I want to add 4 hours of inmar
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 9:26 PM	Yes	I'm sure that you are aware, but I emailed you the zip file
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 12:34 AM	No	Yeah. Can you text brad. Apparently he is suicidal like I was. My family is going through a rough time. My parents might be divorcing. It doesn't affect me as much as it does him. I don't want to script you with something to say, because you did really well with me. I can't talk to him in person until the end of this week and I can go home if necisaary, but I don't want to put that burden on the dohertys unless necissary. Just maybe be a big up us about where you herd it from
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 12:35 AM	No	*ambiguous
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 12:52 AM	Yes	I can, but I'm not entirely sure I am the best person, I was good for you because I was one of the people to whom you opened up, on some level you trusted me and the rest of us there that night and wanted one of us to help. Brad hasn't done that with me and therefore what I say may be less effective. The fact that you know means he had to have opened up to someone, that would be the best person to have talk to him. That being said if you still think it would be beneficial for me to talk to him as well I will of course do that
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 12:55 AM	No	I feel the same way, but u think it is important for him to know that people have his back. The people he opened up to are talking with him, an honestly a text right now would fall on deaf ears unless he waits until he is not so drunk to read it
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 12:55 AM	No	But I don't think it will hurt
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 12:56 AM	No	Unless you think so. You know more about your relationship with him than I do. If you never talk to him like ever then it might not make sense
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 1:01 AM	Yes	I do talk to him occasionally, and care about and am concerned for him, but these things are often something that people want to remain within their inner circle, my only cause for hesitation is that I don't want him thinking that word is getting around, as that may be upsetting. If the people he opened up to are talking with him, and you're planning on talking with him than that should be enough, if not than you may want to consider seeking the help of a professional, I'm conceited but I really can't claim to know how to handle these situations
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 1:03 AM	No	I trust your judgement. It  (judgement) is good
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 1:06 AM	Yes	Okay
+17344782101	Jun 20, 2014, 11:51 AM	Yes	What's your plan?
+13368314649	Jun 20, 2014, 3:03 PM	No	Where are you?
+13368314649	Jun 23, 2014, 1:04 AM	No	"""Ain't it fun"" by paramore is the song I was trying to quote. No idea if you care or not."
+17344782101	Jun 23, 2014, 1:06 AM	Yes	I realized that this morning actually, put on spotifys alternative playlist and it was the first song
+13368314649	Jun 23, 2014, 1:07 AM	No	Hey! If you realized then maybe you got was I was trying to say!
+13368314649	Jun 23, 2014, 1:09 AM	No	God I was drunk on sleep deprivation
+17344782101	Jun 23, 2014, 1:10 AM	Yes	Haha I feel ya
+13368314649	Jun 23, 2014, 1:11 AM	No	I haven't even wanted to drink until today. Damn that was nuts. What are you doing now? I hope I didn't wake you up.
+17344782101	Jun 23, 2014, 1:15 AM	Yes	Haha already? I could go another couple weeks, and watching netflix, wish I was asleep, but my cycle is still all fucked up
+13368314649	Jun 23, 2014, 1:21 AM	No	Yeah. Not hard drinking though. I've had enough of that for the next twenty years. Maybe not. But I am going to get some sleep now. You should watch some Full Metal Alchemist. The overwhelming emotionality of it will make you a bit uncomfortable for a bit if you haven't watched much anime, but it is the only show that I would recommend to pretty much anyone. If you've already seen it, watch Neon Genesis Evangelion. I need someone to help me figure out how to interpret the last two episodes. People don't realize how dark It is until they get pretty far into it. Anyway, if that is not your scene forget all that shit. Goodnight.
+17344782101	Jun 23, 2014, 1:25 AM	Yes	Haha I'm currently in the middle of a show, but might check those out next, night, also are you drunk?
+13368314649	Jun 23, 2014, 1:30 AM	No	No. I had a triple shot of vodka mixed with soda over about fifteen mins, ending 10 mins ago. So I'm feeling it, but I wouldn't call this drunk. Perhaps you disagree, but you obviously haven't seen my drunk texts if so. I really do need to get some sleep though. hugs and kisses goodnight, Mr pilot.
+17344782101	Jun 26, 2014, 1:28 AM	Yes	Sounds good, also you sent that in the group text
+13368314649	Jun 26, 2014, 1:29 AM	No	Ah...
+17344782101	Jun 26, 2014, 1:37 AM	Yes	Haha it's alright, they'll just be confused
+13368314649	Jun 26, 2014, 12:42 PM	No	Nevermind about the JS
+17344782101	Jun 26, 2014, 12:43 PM	Yes	Okay
+13368314649	Jul 1, 2014, 3:27 PM	No	Looks like between our dads' investment advice, yours was right. If I'd been in the market for the past month I'd have made a shitload.
+17344782101	Jul 1, 2014, 3:53 PM	Yes	Haha my dad is pretty good at that stuff, the market is still positively trending by the way
+13368314649	Jul 1, 2014, 3:54 PM	No	Yeah I can tell. How are you doing on that front?
+17344782101	Jul 1, 2014, 4:00 PM	Yes	Pretty good, today was a good day
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 1:42 PM	No	Eric and Brad and I are going to have some drinks by the pool and I figured you might want to participate. Interested?
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 1:45 PM	Yes	I definitely would, unfortunately I won't be back to Winston until 4ish
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 2:40 PM	No	K
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 9:40 PM	Yes	How insecure is using a proxy server?
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 9:40 PM	Yes	I probably mean not secure, but I don't know 
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	It entirely depends on how secure your connections to the proxy server are, and, more dangerously, how secure it's connections are to the thing you want it to access
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	So basically I need more info haha. It can be very secure
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 9:44 PM	Yes	Using proxfree.com to access the collegeboard website
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 9:47 PM	Yes	Don't know if that helps any
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 9:53 PM	No	Go on your college webportal and view your application. Odds are they added the AP scores you sent to your file. I looked at my AP scores last week
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 9:59 PM	Yes	Unfortunately I didn't have mine sent, I already looked via the proxy server was just wondering if it would be a problem
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	You'd be fine
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 10:00 PM	Yes	Sweet, how was the pool?
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	We never went in. We got too down to business coding. We are heading to the dohertys to play cards against humanity now.
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 10:08 PM	Yes	Nice, thought he was in the DR
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 10:10 PM	No	He is. Ha. I am basically a family friend.
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 10:10 PM	No	And Mrs Doherty makes great mixed drinks
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 10:11 PM	Yes	Haha alright
+13368314649	Jul 5, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	Yup. Have a good whateverthefuckyou'redoing
+17344782101	Jul 5, 2014, 10:30 PM	Yes	Thanks man
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 10:08 PM	No	Hey connor, could you do a survey about our spanish project in tenth grade? I am supposed to get multiple accounts of an intense moment for a project I am doing for my english.
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 10:11 PM	Yes	Of course, can I do it in a little bit though? My cs is due at midnight and I am nowhere close to understanding or finishing it
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	I'd love to help. What are you working on?
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 10:17 PM	Yes	I appreciate it, unfortunately they're making us use ocaml for the first part of the semester so I'm not sure there's much you could do
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	Yeah I don't know what that is haha
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	Good luck anyway
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 10:19 PM	Yes	Haha thanks man, how's gt?
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 10:21 PM	No	Great. The city is beautiful, though dangerous, and classes are going well. I had an interview with State farm for an internship this summer. I also joined a frat, but then left it. It's weird: I've basically stopped smoking and drinking since I've gotten to tech.
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	Not because of any resolution to do so, either
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 10:28 PM	Yes	That's good, how'd that go? And damn, sounds like college has been pretty crazy for you, in the strange sense of the word
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 10:29 PM	Yes	Any girls?
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	If you were referring to the interview, I'll know in a couple weeks. And nah; no girls.
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 10:31 PM	Yes	I was, and no time, or nothing interesting?
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	Ha I just haven't met any. Haha and I don't really have an excuse.
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 10:51 PM	Yes	Haha fair enough
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 10:52 PM	No	Yeah I guess. How are things for you?
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 10:57 PM	Yes	They're alright, my total lack of work ethic is really biting me in the ass at the moment though
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 11:04 PM	No	Yeah I am trying hard to stay on top of things before they are due. I don't always succeed haha
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 11:09 PM	Yes	Haha I feel you on that one man, my hw grade is taking a pretty big hit this week
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	Yeah I'm going to be hitting my first calc exam soon. Not going to be fun
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 11:12 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, math here is the hardest thing I've ever done
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 11:12 PM	Yes	And the prof sucks
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 11:16 PM	No	Chinese may as well be a pre requisite for most Math classes at gatech. My TA sucks. She figured out she had taught us the wrong thing after she had spent our entire recitation on it.
+17344782101	Sep 16, 2014, 11:17 PM	Yes	Haha same thing happened to me today, prof spent whole lecture on a proof then realized he fucked it up
+13368314649	Sep 16, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	My professor looks like an undergrad haha. He is actually pretty good, I think.
+13368314649	Sep 17, 2014, 11:55 PM	No	Hey connor, wanna do HackPrinceton with eric and I? (Assuming that I get selected). It's a hackathon that will reimburse you up to $150 in travel fees, and there happens to be a $130 round trip between ATL and Trenton that weekend, so I decided to sign up. It's on November 14-16th. all princeton students are automatically admitted, so perhaps they will favor my application because eric and I are listed as teammates. Are you interested?
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 12:06 AM	Yes	Yeah, that be awesome, how do apply? Also we should do pennapps in the spring, it's kind of a bigger deal than hack princeton
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:09 AM	No	Yeah I'm aware. Didn't it just happen? Who won?
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:10 AM	No	"And yeah, you should just google ""hack princeton"", and the sign up link is obvious. Be sure to put in the team code that I give you."
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:10 AM	No	Team code is 8921105
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:11 AM	No	HackGT is stepping up its game this year. Top prize is $60,000. it's going down this weekend
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 12:13 AM	Yes	It did, but it happens a couple times a year I think, and I'm not sure, I found out about it too late to go cause I thought it was a spring thing, and damn, that's crazy, do we have a project in mind? 
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:15 AM	No	Not yet. Did you sign up? And yeah, I didn't know about HackGT until they had announced participants. We should brainstorm intensively.
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:15 AM	No	Like category 5 brainstorm
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 12:17 AM	Yes	Haha alright, and I'm actually out drinking, so not yet, I will when I get back to my dorm in about an hour though
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:20 AM	No	Haha okay. Have fun.
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 12:25 AM	Yes	#1 party school in the country according to playboy baby
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:26 AM	No	Lols
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 12:27 AM	Yes	Haha yeah, definitely not true I know
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:29 AM	No	Must be some distinguished alums working for that publication
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 12:30 AM	Yes	Haha my thoughts exactly
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:32 AM	No	Anyway, im gonna sleep now. Gotta hate early classes. Hope to see you soon
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 12:33 AM	Yes	Definitely, I'll fill that app out first thing when I get back or first thing tomorrow morning depending on how the night goes
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 11:55 AM	Yes	All signed up, when do we find out if we got it?
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 11:57 AM	No	October 2. I also sent an email asking whether teams are admitted as a unit, or as individuals. Because Eric is guaranteed admission, we could know as soon as I get a response, if the reply is favorable.
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 12:01 PM	Yes	Sweet
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:04 PM	No	Yup. I'm psyched. I really hope all of us get in.
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 12:11 PM	Yes	That be sweet, little worried about not having any past projects to submit though
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 12:15 PM	No	"Yeah... Idk. I guess we can't be sure what their ""acceptance rate"" is. since the event isn't a household name, they might let's lots of people in"
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:16 PM	Yes	Hey, Im having a bit of a web dev issue and was wondering if you could provide some insight. Im trying to modify a site that was built with web.coms website builder. Because of the way that they have things set up, I cannot modify individual html files. I do however have the ability to apply a single css to every html file in there site. What I want to do is remove certain elements on a specific page, which would be very easy, except that those elements appear on all of the pages, and their ids are shared across pages (again I cannot change the ids or write css directly into a specific html file) so when I change it in the global css every page is affected. Do you have any idea if its possible/how to do what Im trying to with the given restrictions?
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:19 PM	No	Can you send me some sample code?
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:19 PM	No	Or access to the builder?
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:22 PM	No	If their id's are not shared across all of the pages, then you should be able to write something like id1, id2, id3 { visibility:none; }
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:23 PM	Yes	The IDs are shared unfortunately, and yeah one sec on the access
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	Pass
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	Ds102593
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	User
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	biancaskids.org
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	Just a heads up the site is a piece of shit
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	Not my work
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:25 PM	No	Oh I misread your text. I see the issue now. Let me explore for a moment. And haha okay I'll wear goggles
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:25 PM	Yes	Also I've been fucking around with it a bit, so you may want to compare to the actual site for an idea of what I'm trying to accomplish
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:26 PM	No	"Yeah I assumed you wouldn't fall for the 'most representative domain' marketing strategy. ""Web.com"" haha"
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:31 PM	Yes	Haha yeah, our client is pretty technologically inept, ideally I would like to just scrap their site and start a new from a pretty bootstrap template, but then I'd have to implement in easy way for them to post updates and that seems like too much work
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:32 PM	No	Okay, well I managed to ftp into the site. You should be able to do basically anything you want from there.
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:33 PM	Yes	I know that I should, but I can't
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:34 PM	Yes	The administrative ftp user doesn't have write permission
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:34 PM	Yes	And even if it did, every time they click publish (which they will be doing frequently) web.com undoes all of your changes so that their builder doesn't get fucked up,
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:35 PM	Yes	It's really a rather shitty system
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:35 PM	No	I just fixed a comma error in the index.html. let's see if it worked.
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:36 PM	Yes	Even if it does, the changes will be undone next time they hit publish
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:36 PM	No	Yeah. So I could edit.
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:36 PM	No	Yeah. So let's figure out how to solve that.
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:39 PM	No	"So if you go into the site builder, you can click on the page editor tab. From there, you can click on an on-screen block and then select ""code"" in the page editor tab. You can then edit html"
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:40 PM	Yes	Yeah, as far as I've seen that's only for specific elements, not the overall site template 
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:40 PM	No	What do you want to do?
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:43 PM	Yes	Go to the retail store page, I want to embed a zazzle store in that content block
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:43 PM	Yes	And make that content block fill most of the screen 
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:43 PM	No	And it gets removed every time she clicks publish?
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:45 PM	Yes	My changes to the site html? Yes
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:45 PM	Yes	The html injected in the builder? No
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:49 PM	No	Alright well this is kinda hackey, but you could inject a fixed div that fills the whole window to cover the default stuff, and then just set the overflow to 'scroll' so that it has the appearance of a normal window.
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:56 PM	No	If you create a new page outside the builder, does it track it?
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:57 PM	Yes	Haha super hackey, but I like it, and I'm not sure I understand what you mean?
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 1:58 PM	No	It doesnt. So try publishing something. I want to see if it overwrites a page I added
	Nov 12, 2014, 1:58 PM	Yes	Okay, give me a minute, walking at the moment
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:03 PM	Yes	It won't publish
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:03 PM	No	Okay. Any error messages?
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:04 PM	Yes	
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:05 PM	Yes	(Multiple Times)
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:07 PM	No	Ha did you try those things? Otherwise I'd say that it is probably the page I added
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:07 PM	No	This thing does suck
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:08 PM	No	Why don't you just copy the whole thing over onto a WordPress install
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:14 PM	Yes	So it actually decided to work now
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:14 PM	Yes	Changes should be published
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:16 PM	Yes	Was your page deleted?
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:18 PM	No	It was not. So that's your solution. I deleted my test page.
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:18 PM	Yes	How do I link to the external page though?
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:18 PM	Yes	and thanks\
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:18 PM	Yes	Would not have figured this out
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:19 PM	No	You would have to write the links. Href=biancaskids.com/yourpage.html
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:20 PM	No	I'd be interested to see what happens if you create a page using the builder that has a naming conflict with a page you already have.
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:20 PM	Yes	Using the injected html?
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:20 PM	Yes	and Ill give that a go as well
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:21 PM	No	Yes. Or try the naming conflict thing
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:20 PM	Yes	Thanks again for your help man
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:22 PM	No	"I'm guessing it won't work. There's probably a check in there that goes something like ""start shouting if the page already exists"". And np. I'm psyched to see you guys friday"
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:26 PM	Yes	Same, its going to be a fun weekend
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:35 PM	Yes	
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:35 PM	Yes	looking like this might actually work
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:36 PM	No	The naming conflict thing?
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:36 PM	No	Not desired  ehavior?
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:37 PM	No	Behavior?
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:37 PM	Yes	Naming conflict = good
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:38 PM	No	So wait I'm confused. Are we done or no?
	Nov 12, 2014, 2:38 PM	Yes	Haha Im not done, but I think I have the ability to modify html
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 2:39 PM	No	Okay coolio. See ya
	Nov 15, 2014, 11:15 AM	Yes	Hey

+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 7:53 PM	Yes	We need to learn to be more flexible
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	I'd love to 
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	But hopefully with everyone
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 7:53 PM	Yes	We should be able to play any song a man down
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	You can't play without me! I AM IRREPLACEABLE 
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	Haha not without the lead guitarist/cello player 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 7:54 PM	Yes	Man being anyone except you or Catherine Josiah
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	Sure we could do it but I'm just saying 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 7:55 PM	Yes	David we have two rhythm guitarist
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 7:55 PM	Yes	Half the time you and I play the same thing
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 7:55 PM	No	Let's do an acoustic gig with just Connor
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 7:55 PM	No	Give him a kazoo and bongos and have him do all of the songs
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 7:56 PM	No	"""Mounts unplugged"""
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 7:56 PM	No	We play the same stuff sometimes but not half the time 
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	Look I'm just saying we don't have to go out of our way to schedule a gig when we know someone can't make it
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 7:58 PM	Yes	David my point is that no matter when the gig is someone is probably not going to be able to make it
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 7:58 PM	No	Why don't we relax, try to finish our originals, and if a gig pops up where we can all make it then that's be great 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 7:59 PM	Yes	There is never going to be a gig that we can all make it to because the band just isn't that high up on anyone's priority list
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 7:59 PM	Yes	I'm not calling anyone out or complaining
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 7:59 PM	Yes	That's just how it is
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 7:59 PM	No	We can definitely still have a gig where everyone can come
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 7:59 PM	No	Just not as often 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:00 PM	Yes	One gig a month is not very often
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:00 PM	Yes	And I have yet to hear of any opportunities that we can all attend
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	We don't have to have a ton of gigs 
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	Why don't we *schedule* a gig everyone can attend...?
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	Exactly 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:01 PM	Yes	Because we are not in demand enough to schedule a gig
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:01 PM	Yes	We have to take opportunities that come
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:01 PM	Yes	And they aren't going to just come whenever it is convenient
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	"I don't really think we have to ""take"" anything but that's my opinion; we aren't starving artists "
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	I will do whatever you decide is best and I can play the gig 
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:02 PM	No	I agree with Daniel 
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:02 PM	No	But I would rather we work as a band and write our own music and create an EP and make an opportunity for ourselves to be in demand rather than eating table scraps 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:03 PM	Yes	No one is going to buy an ep from a band they have never heard of
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:03 PM	Yes	We are not starving artists
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:03 PM	No	Then why is the money a concern here?
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:03 PM	No	It doesn't matter about making money 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:03 PM	Yes	It's not about the damn money
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:04 PM	Yes	It's about marketing ourselves, and getting our name out
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:04 PM	Yes	I don't care about selling the ep to make money
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:04 PM	Yes	I care because I think that
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	Connor, playing small gigs in Winston Salem is not going to get our name out particularly well 
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	Would having the EP first not be better?
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	I'd rather get our name out with quality instead of quantity with missing band members 
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	Then we would have something to market
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:04 PM	Yes	Havin. An ep that people listen to would be way better than just having an ep
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:05 PM	Yes	And because they are not mutually exclusive 
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	I'm saying that we need an EP first
+13368165198	Mar 3, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	I buy EPs of bands I haven't heard of and we aren't getting paid for either gig
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	I think the ep should be our priority in my opinion 
+13368165198	Mar 3, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	Second
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	If we have an EP, then we have something that people can listen to from us
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:05 PM	Yes	You buy eps of signed bands with record labels spending a lot of money to get them io you
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:05 PM	Yes	We don't have that
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:06 PM	Yes	And they aren't mutually exclusive
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:06 PM	Yes	We can work on the ep and play gigs
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	Connor. Why get our name out without an\LFEP? 
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	Not really
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	They're kind of each time consuming 
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	In different and non-complimentary ways
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:07 PM	No	As in, practice time would have to be spent on working on covers rather than writing, or wouldn't be spent recording. Does that make sense?
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:07 PM	No	We logistically don't have enough time to work on enough other people's music to play a gig as well as write our own, I don't think
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:08 PM	Yes	We cannot write music at practice without certain people
+13368165198	Mar 3, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	Honestly, we won't make it big by playing in Winston and it's not worth the effort to adapt to gigs without everyone, I'm telling them we can't play it
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	Why not?
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	"I think we will make way more progress as a band with our own music out rather than playing gigs we have to ""take"""
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	Writing doesn't require anyone but one person Connor
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	Why can't we write without some people? Our two originals were written by Connor alone
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:09 PM	Yes	Then practice time doesn't even need to be spent on originals
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:09 PM	No	Connor, why do you want to make these gigs happen so badly?
+13368165198	Mar 3, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	Because he wants ladies
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	I'm saying somebody write something and then we all come together and figure out the music part. That or at band practice, whoever is there writes
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:10 PM	Yes	Because I love music, and because I want to play every chance I get
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	That happens at practice just as much as at a concert
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	Yeah I'm with Connor about playing gigs, I love gigs more than anything else we do because it's what we work for. 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:10 PM	Yes	Practice is not performing Daniel
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	Right, we're not saying we shouldn't have gigs 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:11 PM	Yes	And don't give me any condescending bullshit indicating you feel otherwise
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	Yeah, but at some point we have to wean ourselves off of replicating other people's music
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	I think we should take whatever gigs we can take but also work on getting 2 or 3 more originals so we can record
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:11 PM	No	Wow Connor, chill thy tits
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:11 PM	No	Nobody is being condescending, Connor.
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Yeah I want to be able to play concerts with originals. 
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	And an EP would allow people to hear us and want to hear it live
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	It would distinguish our band as well 
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	We are.....
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Nor is there any need to be an assface about this. If you don't want to discuss this, it's fine, just don't waste my time by insulting me 
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	THE HEARD
+13368165198	Mar 3, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	We can't take these gigs because not everyone will be there
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	I think we could do the habitat thing, especially if we went acoustic
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Why don't we just vote on it?
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Without Evan? And 2 hours of music? 
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Would that not make the most sense? 
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	It would let's vote 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	Yes	We will vote
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	So...let's vote...?
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	I vote yes
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Wait, how big is the crowd?
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	I vote no 
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	I vote no 
+13364068233	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	What are we voting on exactly?
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Doing the habitat gig
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	Doing the 22nd without you 
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	You're ineligible for voting on this one I think
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:16 PM	Yes	I agree
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:16 PM	Yes	And yes
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:16 PM	Yes	Jay, Catherine?
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:16 PM	Yes	We are flipping a coin if there's a tie
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	No I say we don't do it if it's a tie. 
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	Why would we do it if it's a tie? 
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	Yeah if half the band is opposed I don't think we should do it
+17758154378	Mar 3, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	Jay and Catherine need yo vote still 
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:23 PM	Yes	This band is opposed to everything, we have not had a single conversation about performing without someone listing a bunch of reasons why we shouldn't do it, I am all about the EP and have been the whole time, if y'all don't want to perform and just focus on that than that's fine
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:24 PM	Yes	But recognize that someone will always have a reason not to play a gig
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	Mounts I'm fine with performing, but I'd rather get an ep out first and schedule gigs that everyone can make it too or that we're ready for 
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:28 PM	No	Let's have a practice as soon as possible and focus on nothing but writing music. Then we can see how that goes? Just an idea
+13366712099	Mar 3, 2014, 8:29 PM	No	WOW. GUYS FOR THE LOVE OF MUSIC. Remember why you wanted to start this and why I wanted to be a part of this. You all sound like 8th grade girls. This is meant to rewarding and FUN. 
+13366712099	Mar 3, 2014, 8:29 PM	No	An EP is time consuming and needs to be written. One gig in between won't kill us and we should be testing the waters with the originals we want to produce at said gigs. EP comes first but a little gig would maybe give us a little boost. 
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	Yeah I think gigs are a good idea, especially since we already have a bunch of music so we wouldn't have to spend much practice time on them. It's a way to get comfortable live, test out music and get our name out there
+13368165198	Mar 3, 2014, 8:32 PM	No	I vote no and I'm declining it because I'm not willing to cram and try to adapt in one week for a pancake brunch gig
+13366712099	Mar 3, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	so no go for pancake jamboree. ok
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:34 PM	No	I'm trying to have another maji club thing on the 28th or 29th. We'd only have to play for as long as we wanted. Would you guys be free or up for it?
+13364086079	Mar 3, 2014, 8:34 PM	No	Okay so back to Josiah's idea how about we focus on our own music next practice 
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	But yes, let's write at the next practice. I just want our music in motion
+13366712099	Mar 3, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	agreed
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:45 PM	Yes	I think it may be important to mention that at some point we will play the auction gig, that we need to be prepared and that it would be really fantastic if we could all show up
+13366712099	Mar 3, 2014, 8:45 PM	No	LOL THE CHASES WON THAT
+13366959263	Mar 3, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	Haha did you have a hand in that, Cromie?
+13366712099	Mar 3, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	not at all but they told me and at first i thought it was so awkward... but now at least they'll work with my schedule :D
+17344782101	Mar 3, 2014, 8:47 PM	Yes	Haha that is a huge relief actually, nevertheless we still need to do a good job
+13366712099	Mar 3, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	yeh agreed
+13368165198	Mar 3, 2014, 8:50 PM	No	Meh
+13366959263	Mar 6, 2014, 7:44 PM	No	Hey are we able to do something the 28th or 29th for maji club. If not, I can just play music in my phone but I think it would be fun to do another (possibly acoustic) sesh. Might not be worth the work so no pressure
+13368165198	Mar 6, 2014, 7:44 PM	No	Habitat build that day
+13366959263	Mar 6, 2014, 7:46 PM	No	Daaaaang
+13364068233	Mar 6, 2014, 7:46 PM	No	
+13366959263	Mar 6, 2014, 7:48 PM	No	Zaaaaamn gurl
+13366959263	Mar 6, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	@ethannoble
+13368165198	Mar 6, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	Zambia 
+13368165198	Mar 6, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	Autocorrect TRUCK
+13366959263	Mar 6, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	I guess we could do an acoustic set without Jay if the rest of you guys are available 
+13364068233	Mar 6, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	I'm in habitat 
+17758154378	Mar 6, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	I'm in prison
+13366959263	Mar 6, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	I'm in pain
+13368165198	Mar 6, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	Josiah is in habitat too right?
+13366959263	Mar 6, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	Haha sure why not?
+13366712099	Mar 6, 2014, 11:50 PM	No	I JUST LANDED IN DUBLIN ASDFGHJKL
+17758154378	Mar 6, 2014, 11:50 PM	No	You're probably paying 5 dollars per text
+13366712099	Mar 6, 2014, 11:50 PM	No	Naa iMessage is free with wifi
+13368165198	Mar 6, 2014, 11:51 PM	No	That's awesome! Say hey to Ireland for me and no Danny is iMessage 
+13364068233	Mar 6, 2014, 11:53 PM	No	That's really cool Catherine!
+13366712099	Mar 7, 2014, 12:04 AM	No	I'm pretty pumped 
+13368165198	Mar 7, 2014, 12:05 AM	No	Isn't it like 6 in the morning?
+17758154378	Mar 7, 2014, 12:05 AM	No	5
+17758154378	Mar 7, 2014, 12:05 AM	No	It's GMT

+13368165198	Mar 7, 2014, 12:10 AM	No	Daniel was
+13366712099	Mar 7, 2014, 12:11 AM	No	Dun dun duuuun

+17758154378	Mar 8, 2014, 9:34 AM	No	If we wanna do more covers, we should cover photograph by Def Leppard - it's right in Connor's voice range for the verse and Catherine can do the chorus 
+13364068233	Mar 8, 2014, 10:18 AM	No	It's a good song, but is it too rock-y?

+13364068233	May 18, 2014, 8:54 PM	No	Do you think we should say in the group chat that we're gonna smoke, just so they know?
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 9:02 PM	Yes	No
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 9:03 PM	Yes	No reason to make an issue out of it

+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 2:51 PM	Yes	Yeah, the meals are rather frustrating though, say down for dinner two and a half hours ago and we haven't got to the appetizer yet
+13364068233	Jul 19, 2014, 3:05 PM	No	How the fuck does that happen?
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 3:06 PM	Yes	It's just how they do, haha dinner takes like five hours

+13364068233	Aug 13, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	I might come by for a few minutes and also get my stuff
+17344782101	Aug 13, 2014, 10:32 PM	Yes	Okay

marymounts@icloud.com	Feb 21, 2014, 11:55 AM	No	You are da best!
marymounts@icloud.com	Feb 21, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	Did you reAch him!
marymounts@icloud.com	Feb 21, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 24, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	How are you?  I gave been sending texts from phone but think you are not getting them. How did the math go?
+17344782101	Apr 24, 2014, 9:50 PM	Yes	I have been getting them all, I don't think you have been getting my responses, I'm good, love and miss you, math went fine, hope all is well in Italy
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 24, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	I have not gotten any responses. Did you place in the competition?  Everyone behaving for mike?  Love and miss you
+17344782101	Apr 24, 2014, 9:53 PM	Yes	Not even close, and yes, love you
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 24, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	Awww. Did you gave fun?
+17344782101	Apr 24, 2014, 9:55 PM	Yes	Yes, I did not expect to place, but I did find a flaw with one of the questions and that is about the most significant accomplishment I could have hoped to achieve at the competition without about four years of practice
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 24, 2014, 10:01 PM	No	Dud you tell them about it? You are soon impressive. What are you doing this weekend?
+17344782101	Apr 24, 2014, 10:42 PM	Yes	Yes, and I don't know yet
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 25, 2014, 5:17 PM	No	Be good this weekend. Can you tell me what the attachment from mr mcbride says. I forwarded you the email. I cannot open the attachment. Love you
+17344782101	Apr 25, 2014, 6:52 PM	Yes	I will, love you

+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 5:06 PM	Yes	Love and miss you too, it's going well
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 28, 2014, 5:07 PM	No	I want to hear about the pranks!
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 5:17 PM	Yes	My only prank has been to dress down, they really aren't letting us do anything, but I'm really not involved at all, today the school made us go to a lunch and asked us to donate money
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 28, 2014, 5:30 PM	No	Money for what?  Why aren't you involved. Are the kids treating you okay?
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 5:35 PM	Yes	Haha I don't want to be a pain in the ass at school and you think something's wrong, I'm being treated fine, I just realize that I have substantially more to lose than 95% of those kids, and for the Forsyth fund, trying to get us started as donors at a young age
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 28, 2014, 5:39 PM	No	Yes you do have more to lose I am proud of you for realizing that. You are an awesome kid   We already give lots to the fund!
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 5:48 PM	Yes	I know, they weren't asking the parents, they were asking the kids to donate
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 28, 2014, 5:50 PM	No	That is really not right...... It is our money you would be giving anyway!  How was the lunch at any rate?
+17344782101	Apr 28, 2014, 5:51 PM	Yes	That's not the point, they are trying to get us in the habit of donating to the school, and it was okay
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 28, 2014, 5:51 PM	No	I understand
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 29, 2014, 6:02 PM	No	How was your day?  I miss you 
+17344782101	Apr 29, 2014, 6:13 PM	Yes	It was good, love and miss you too
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 30, 2014, 2:13 AM	No	Can't wait to see you Friday 
+17344782101	Apr 30, 2014, 9:46 AM	Yes	Love and miss you, can't wait to see you as well, please keep in mind Friday is the last day of school and if you wouldn't mind I would probably like to go out with friends to celebrate
marymounts@icloud.com	Apr 30, 2014, 12:04 PM	No	I know I figured you would. Love you
+13366089582	Feb 21, 2014, 4:28 PM	No	Connor can you come and get me
+13366089582	Jun 26, 2014, 2:59 PM	No	R u coming

+13366089582	Jun 26, 2014, 2:59 PM	No	Over by the Lower school
+13366089582	Jun 26, 2014, 3:00 PM	No	R u in the Lexus?
+14235983552	Feb 21, 2014, 5:24 PM	No	Poker tonight! Who's down?
+14235983552	Feb 21, 2014, 5:44 PM	No	Already got one taker 
+13367757093	Feb 21, 2014, 5:45 PM	No	Depends on the time
+14235983552	Feb 21, 2014, 5:53 PM	No	What time would work for you?
+13367757093	Feb 21, 2014, 5:53 PM	No	Don't know
+12679073515	Feb 21, 2014, 5:53 PM	No	You guys need some moonshine?
+13367757093	Feb 21, 2014, 5:53 PM	No	Nope, I'll take it as stakes in poker though 
+14235983552	Feb 21, 2014, 5:55 PM	No	Oooooh them's some high stakes haha
+14235983552	Feb 21, 2014, 9:19 PM	No	Gentlemen, any word on participation?
+14235983552	Feb 21, 2014, 10:27 PM	No	Gents?
+12679073515	Feb 21, 2014, 10:41 PM	No	I'm in Raleigh
+14235983552	Feb 21, 2014, 10:41 PM	No	Aight
+14235983552	Feb 21, 2014, 10:49 PM	No	Hey, I actually think tomorrow will work better
+14235983552	Feb 22, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	Gentlemen, due to scheduling conflicts yesterday's poker game has been moved to today, any takers?
+13367757093	Feb 22, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	I can't 
+13369707948	Feb 22, 2014, 4:57 PM	No	Me and Colton are down 
+14235983552	Feb 22, 2014, 5:06 PM	No	Sweet
+15085051019	Feb 24, 2014, 10:07 PM	No	Hey is our Spanish III video online?
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:13 PM	Yes	Think you may have meant to send this to a 774 number
+15085051019	Feb 24, 2014, 10:14 PM	No	Is this Connor?
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:15 PM	Yes	Yes, who is this?
+15085051019	Feb 24, 2014, 10:14 PM	No	Octavio
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:17 PM	Yes	Haha oh, thats why it's a boston number, I don't think so, you might want to check with Brian and Eric
+15085051019	Feb 24, 2014, 10:18 PM	No	You should ask Brian to put it on YouTube. It's a classic
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:50 PM	Yes	Haha alright I will
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:31 PM	Yes	Unfortunately Catherine is a no go for Thursday, this means that unless we can find a decent female vocalist we are going to have to have additional practices and adjust the keys of a few of the songs
+13364068233	Feb 24, 2014, 10:32 PM	No	Why can't she do it?
+13364086079	Feb 24, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	Does she not know how important this is? 
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	So she's not in the band anymore, essentially? 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:33 PM	Yes	She has a mandatory choir event, that she would not miss even if she were permitted to
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	Oh Truhel
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	They're being adjudicated
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	Excuse me while I put my head in a blender
+13364086079	Feb 24, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	Dammit Truhel 
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	Well, think of it this way. We've practiced without her for so long I feel like it would have been more stressful to incorporate her Wednesday night. At least now we know where we stand.
+13364068233	Feb 24, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	Yea we know that we can play it all
+13364086079	Feb 24, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	Good point 
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	That's a good way of putting it. Next gig I'll make sure she knows everything she needs to know ahead of time. We just need to get better at obtaining all details about a gig well in advance before even deciding whether or not to do it. Band meeting tomorrow during lunch?
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	I am completely confident in our ability to succeed without her singing
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	They've known about that chorus event for two months...
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	Yes	Yes, and Catherine knew the date of the gig as well
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	Yeah but she didnt know the gig was during school until today
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	I'm kind of irritated that she said she could do the gig, to be honest
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	...why would she not know that until today?
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	I think there was fault on both sides
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	Oh well!
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	We didnt tell her until today
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:40 PM	Yes	There was definitely fault on both sides, but we are the side that is getting fucked
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	We just have to make the best of it, and Connor can sing all of the songs just as well
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	It doesn't really matter, honestly. We've only ever heard these songs without her singing 
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:41 PM	No	Nobody is getting fucked, let's just crush this gig as prove a point to ourselves 
+13364086079	Feb 24, 2014, 10:43 PM	No	Yeah I wish she could be there for the gig but I agree with Porada 
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	Yeah I'm with Daniel, we've got this! We sounded really good today
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:44 PM	Yes	I am with ya Daniel, we still need to rehearse more now though, there are going to be things that need to be changed
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	To be completely honest I was really surprised how good everything sounded today
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	It came together phenomenally 
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	I have a small request regarding extra practice though; because evan and i are missing school for WRO too, I need to take a bunch of extra tests and quizzes this week and that therefore means more studying, so practice needs to be at a reasonable hour
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 10:47 PM	Yes	I agree this week is crazy, and recognize that it is short notice, but if enough of us can make it we should have practice tomorrow right after practices
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 10:47 PM	No	Fair enough 
+13364068233	Feb 24, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	Yea that's fair
+13364068233	Feb 24, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	I still think well perform great Thursday like Porada said
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:02 PM	No	I'm on your maaaagical mystery ride 
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	YOURE CRAZY AND IM OUT OF MY MIIIIND
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	He's coming to Charlotte, we should go 
+13368165198	Feb 24, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	40 new messages, unacceptable 
+13368165198	Feb 24, 2014, 11:16 PM	No	So we're cutting what? \LFCounting Stars\LFBeautiful Day\LFViva la Vida\LFRolling in the Deep \LFSomewhere Over Rainbow\LFAnd Home?
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:18 PM	No	Just somewhere over the rainbow and rolling in the deep, I believe
+13368165198	Feb 24, 2014, 11:19 PM	No	We can't sing the others as of today
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:19 PM	No	We did all of those fine...?
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:20 PM	Yes	Pessimism is useless jay
+13364086079	Feb 24, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	Yeah what are you talking about? We had a great practice 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:20 PM	Yes	Although I am with you on home, it's kind of a duet
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	Yeah it doesn't make much sense
+13364068233	Feb 24, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	Nah me and Connor can sing the duet
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:20 PM	No	We can add it to the playlist though!
+13364086079	Feb 24, 2014, 11:21 PM	No	Oh that's true 
+13368165198	Feb 24, 2014, 11:21 PM	No	We had a great practice but viva la vida and counting stars are Catherine songs 
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:21 PM	Yes	Viva la vida and counting stars are Catherine songs in the key they are in
+13364086079	Feb 24, 2014, 11:21 PM	No	But we can still do them 
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:21 PM	No	Why? We've never sung them with her 
+13364086079	Feb 24, 2014, 11:22 PM	No	We can do both of those just fine? Didn't you sing those in practice mounts? 
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:22 PM	No	Why are we attributing so much of our potential success to someone who hasn't practiced with us this year? 
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:23 PM	No	Not to be mean, just to be realistic 
+13368165198	Feb 24, 2014, 11:23 PM	No	It is my opinion that those songs are too high for mounts to sing

+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:28 PM	Yes	If it's short you can probably skip? People do get sick jay

+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 11:32 PM	No	That would be cool
+17758154378	Feb 24, 2014, 11:32 PM	No	It's a private gig haha it was a joke
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:33 PM	Yes	Don't take this wrong way, but you being at meeting for 30 minutes is not going to raise 18000 dollars
+13366959263	Feb 24, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	I know, but it would be cool if people were willing to pay to hear us play
+17344782101	Feb 24, 2014, 11:33 PM	Yes	Furthermore habitat is going to pursue the same ideas regardless of whether or not you attend the meeting

+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:26 PM	No	A lady asked on our Facebook page if we would do her 14 year old daughters bday party and be a 1D cover band
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:26 PM	No	I vote yes 
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 8:29 PM	No	Did this actually happen?
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:29 PM	No	Yes

+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:31 PM	Yes	This didn't happen
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	So confused

+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	It seems like something a mother would actually request
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:33 PM	Yes	Shit it actually did happen
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:33 PM	Yes	We need to manage that page a little more actively
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	Your fault Mr. Manager
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:33 PM	No

+13364068233	Feb 27, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	When was that posted

+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:35 PM	Yes	Someone must have looked at it at some point because it was marked as read when I got there
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	That would be me
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	I figured you see the messages too though
+13364068233	Feb 27, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	D'OH!!
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:36 PM	Yes	Yeah well I didn't, because you'd already read it, so it's your fault, now we'll never get to be a 1d cover band for a bunch of thirteen year old girls in Virginia 
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	I'm so sorry
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	Guys throw me out of te band
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	I still can't find this message

+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 8:38 PM	No	Yeah we need to reply haha 
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:38 PM	Yes	I think we just need to send an apology
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 8:38 PM	No	Ask when her birthday is and apologize for not responding early 
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 8:38 PM	No	Earlier 
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 8:38 PM	No	Will do
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:39 PM	Yes	Something along the lines of us not actively managing the page
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 8:39 PM	Yes	Correction: of Daniel opening messages before I see them
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	IM SORRY

+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	I replied
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 8:50 PM	No	I read Connors text as thirteen year old virgins and thought what the fuck mounts 
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 8:53 PM	No	I thought the exact same thing :/
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 8:58 PM	No	VIRGINS
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 9:00 PM	Yes	I meant virgins, Virginia was a typo
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	Haha I thought you wanted the middle school rape rumor to end but then you go and say that
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 9:04 PM	Yes	I don't remember that ever being a rumor
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 9:05 PM	Yes	And though I fell it is pretty obvious, I am going to go ahead and say I was being sarcastic
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 9:05 PM	Yes	Feel
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:14 PM	No	I'm kidding
+17344782101	Feb 27, 2014, 9:15 PM	Yes	Yeah probably overreacted a little bit there, I apologize it's been a long week
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:17 PM	No	No you didn't, it's all good babe
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	What songs are we going to start working on? 
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	Our originals 
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	Time to finally get them done haha 
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	My votes are \LFUp Up and Away\LFLet Her Go\LFAnd I know Dave wants to do pursuit of happiness in addition to our originals
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	I'd rather finish our originals and then work on more covers 
+13364068233	Feb 27, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	sure
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	King wizard
+13364068233	Feb 27, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	im just schilll with watever mann
+13364068233	Feb 27, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	sooo chillll
+13364068233	Feb 27, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	chhiiiiiill

+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	Clearly
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	David we can do both, finishing originals only happens at practice so we might as well learn something in between practices where we can finish the originals and be making progress on covers at the same time
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	Yeah but I'd rather spend the time at practice finishing the songs instead of rehearsing new covers 
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Sure you can learn them on your own time but during practice id rather finish the songs 
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	We can do both
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Okay as long as practice is spent on the originals haha 
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	It can be spent on both 
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Once again that's both
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Both
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Originals are a priority
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	But we need to be improving upon both and have a deeper set list
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	Well what I'm saying is I'd rather have our originals finished and ready to perform then spend that same practice time on something else 
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	But I see what you're saying, sounds good 
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	We would spend different practice time on each
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	I don't want to practice 
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	It's what it feels like too Josi
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	Can we have nap time 
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	I hate music 
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	No Daniel 
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	I hate this group text more every day
+17758154378	Feb 27, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	Haha I just want to get these damn originals done jay 
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	Before we focus on other things

+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	Yeah I say originals and EP are at practice with maybe one new cover song per practice.
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	Yeah 
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	#problem silver

+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 10:41 PM	No	Did you guys see the lady's reply on Facebook? She wants us to play in September. I'm thinking that won't happen
+13364086079	Feb 27, 2014, 10:41 PM	No	Yeah that's pretty unlikely 
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	I mean, unless you guys wanna make it like a last thing we do before college life really starts
+13366959263	Feb 27, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	1D might not be the ideal climax in our music careers though
+13368165198	Feb 27, 2014, 10:46 PM	No	I climax to 1D all the time

+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:41 PM	No	The thing I wanted to tell you about scholarship day is that guys like us can't really get the scholarships because they aren't need blind
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:41 PM	No	They give them to people who 100% want to go to chapel hill and need the money; I didn't get one and we called the admissions office and they explained it 
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	Although if you do get one congratulations! I just don't want you to be surprised or disappointed like I was
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:43 PM	Yes	Congrats, and thanks for the heads up, I figured that the 100% going to chapel hill thing might become an issue
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:43 PM	No	They try to give them to people they know want to go
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	You and I are using it as a fallback 
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:44 PM	Yes	Isn't everyone who is qualified to get invited using it as a fallback?
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:44 PM	Yes	That or they are serious underachievers
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	I thought so too but a lot of the people there had already enrolled at Carolina
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:45 PM	No	So we're disadvantaged 
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:45 PM	No	And I thought they would use them to lure us but I guess it isn't like the Moorehead 
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:46 PM	Yes	I might be able to work around that issue, I actually haven't been accepted yet
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:46 PM	No	To Carolina?
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:48 PM	Yes	Yes, and you'd think the lure thing would be the case
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:49 PM	Yes	No way I could be enrolled, if anything I could be eager to receive my letter
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:49 PM	No	They want to reward kids who really want to go is the idea I think
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	The reception is SWEET though
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:51 PM	No	The deserts are orgasmatastic. Be sure to take one of each
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	The raspberry streusel bars almost made it worth my time hahahaha
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:54 PM	Yes	Haha I will, and that may be the case more with sd1? That way they can offer a similar amount at sd2, targeted more at luring? Because they can just recycle that if they aren't all commits
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:55 PM	Yes	In which case you just got unlucky
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	Oh yeah I probably screwed myself
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	That's poo
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:54 PM	No	I go for free anyways so it doesn't really matter hahahaha it would have just been for the certificate
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:56 PM	No	I guess karma didn't want me to get a double free ride xD 
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 9:56 PM	Yes	Haha that probably didn't help your chances
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	My only other advice is to come Into the debate swinging because the moderators are idiots and don't say anything
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	So my debate was one annoying girl talking the whole time
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	Because no one wanted to be rude and interrupt
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 10:03 PM	Yes	Haha thanks for the advice
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 10:03 PM	No	You know we're the first people to ever get invited from our school?
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 10:03 PM	No	Ms. Perry didn't even know what this was
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 10:07 PM	Yes	Haha didn't know that, Lorna played it off like it wasn't that big a deal
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 10:09 PM	Yes	Think it has anything to do with our minority status?
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 10:10 PM	Yes	Especially as it is more like financial aid than merit scholarships
+17758154378	Mar 5, 2014, 10:11 PM	No	I thought it did but a bunch of really rich white\LFkids were there as well
+17344782101	Mar 5, 2014, 10:19 PM	Yes	I am quite confused by how unc operates their scholarship programs
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 10:28 AM	Yes	I want to apologize for last night, and I know it's my fault and that I'm an asshole for what I did, and that it probably appears as if I don't care, but I wanted to make sure she's okay? I'm sure that she is, and doubt highly that there is anything I can do to make her feel better, but if there is and you wouldn't mind telling me I would really appreciate getting to know
+17758154378	Mar 8, 2014, 10:48 AM	No	She's better now; I think all she really needs is time honestly 
+17758154378	Mar 8, 2014, 10:48 AM	No	Why are you apologizing to me? 
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 11:05 AM	Yes	Okay, and because you are the one I left her with
+17758154378	Mar 13, 2014, 12:00 PM	No	You may want to tell that lady on Facebook that we don't want to do it
+17758154378	Mar 13, 2014, 12:00 PM	No	No one answered her again
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 12:05 PM	Yes	Josiah should because he already contacted her
+17758154378	Mar 13, 2014, 12:14 PM	No	Is he in town?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 1:31 PM	Yes	I think so
+17758154378	Mar 13, 2014, 1:31 PM	No	What've you been up to?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 1:33 PM	Yes	Im at vanderbilt, flew back in from the dr yesterday, you?
+17758154378	Mar 13, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	The DR trip is already over?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 2:48 PM	Yes	No, I left early
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 2:52 PM	Yes	Everyone else is leaving tomorrow
+17758154378	Mar 13, 2014, 3:02 PM	No	Gotcha; I've had the most boring spring break ever because my parents didn't even know I was off this week until last Saturday
+17344782101	Mar 15, 2014, 8:01 PM	Yes	Did you get an email about speaking with someone from unc's board of visitors?
+17344782101	Mar 15, 2014, 8:35 PM	Yes	Also was the required reading for scholarship day an entire book?
+17758154378	Mar 15, 2014, 9:03 PM	No	The required reading is an article, the book is a gift 
+17758154378	Mar 15, 2014, 9:03 PM	No	I got the email and I signed up for the call 
+17344782101	Mar 15, 2014, 9:13 PM	Yes	Good, that book is long
+17758154378	Mar 15, 2014, 9:14 PM	No	It's like getting the Yale book award
+17758154378	Mar 17, 2014, 7:26 PM	No	What exactly is your dad's relation to wake innovations? Did he just buy the space?
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 7:27 PM	Yes	I have no idea, why?
+17758154378	Mar 17, 2014, 7:27 PM	No	I'm just wondering because I'm working with wake innovations and I was curious if we would ever work together!
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 7:31 PM	Yes	I'm sure that the two do work together on some things, but the scope of Eric, jay, jay and I's project is pretty small so I don't think there will be much overlap, what are you doing for wake innovations? 
+17758154378	Mar 17, 2014, 7:31 PM	No	Whatever Dr. Tomlinson tells me to do hahahaha
+17758154378	Mar 17, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	My internship will probably be less project oriented than yours and more acquiring broad knowledge about how each different aspect functions 
+17758154378	Mar 17, 2014, 7:37 PM	No	Mostly because I have no idea what I'm doing
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 7:41 PM	Yes	That sounds kind of nice actually, I'm not really a fan of the idea that I will actually be expected to produce something
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 5:25 PM	Yes	My article for unc is quite over my head
+17758154378	Mar 18, 2014, 7:19 PM	No	What is it?
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 7:21 PM	Yes	It's about the internet, it's not terrible, it's just that it assumes a pretty deep level of understanding of how it works and every couple lines there's a reference to some obscure related company that I've never heard off and don't know what they've done
+17758154378	Mar 18, 2014, 7:21 PM	No	I gotcha 
+17758154378	Mar 27, 2014, 3:24 PM	No	Got it! It's on the main Columbia website 
+17758154378	Mar 27, 2014, 3:24 PM	No	I would make an account as soon as you can because the servers get overloaded
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 3:40 PM	Yes	Thanks, will do
+17758154378	Mar 27, 2014, 3:46 PM	No	Is Stanford tomorrow or today?
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 3:47 PM	Yes	Tomorrow at 6
+17758154378	Mar 27, 2014, 3:47 PM	No	I'll keep my fingers crossed for you, and good luck tonight!
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 3:48 PM	Yes	Thanks, you too man!
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 5:29 PM	Yes	How'd it go?
+17758154378	Mar 27, 2014, 5:31 PM	No	Columbia! You?
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 5:32 PM	Yes	Penn, wait listed at columbia, and waiting on Harvard email, congrats man!
+17758154378	Mar 27, 2014, 5:33 PM	No	You too! I'm really really hoping you'll get into Stanford 
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 5:59 PM	Yes	Thanks man
+17758154378	Mar 28, 2014, 6:37 PM	No	Any news?
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 6:41 PM	Yes	I'm officially a penn Quaker 
+17758154378	Mar 28, 2014, 6:43 PM	No	Congratulations!!! UPenn is a fantastic school
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 6:49 PM	Yes	Thanks! I'm definitely excited, congrats again on Columbia!
+17758154378	Mar 28, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	Thank you! Wanna have a band rehearsal/chocolate fondue party this weekend? We really should 
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 6:53 PM	Yes	Haha I'm down
+17758154378	Apr 25, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	Hey is my electric violin at your house?
+17344782101	Apr 25, 2014, 9:51 PM	Yes	It is
+17758154378	Apr 25, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Mkay thanks!
+17758154378	Apr 25, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Just wanted to make sure I hadn't lost it
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 4:24 PM	Yes	
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 4:33 PM	No	Yessssssss
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 4:49 PM	No	I can see us living the wolf of Wall Street type of existence 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 4:55 PM	Yes	I like hookers
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 4:55 PM	Yes	And cocaine
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 4:55 PM	Yes	Works for me
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 6:45 PM	No	When do we get the testosterone for our asses?
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 6:49 PM	Yes	After paper scissors takes off and we decide to emulate black people
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	I'm gold plating my dick
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 6:50 PM	No	I'm also getting a signature wall above the headboard of my bed to keep score xD 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 6:52 PM	Yes	I'm gonna go with diamonds, they are less functional and more expensive, if I'm not spending a couple mil a year on medical bills I will be thoroughly disappointed
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 6:53 PM	Yes	I'm going to get gold trophy versions of all of my conquests and put them in a trophy case that spans my house
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 6:56 PM	No	Why not take it a step further and actually gold plate your conquests? Then they'll never be with another man
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 7:02 PM	Yes	That's brilliant, ideas like these are why collaboration amongst Ivy League students is so essential to progress
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	That and so that we can figure ways to better employ the student who did not attend Ivy League institutions - it is, after all, our civic duty 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 7:19 PM	Yes	Yes, but only to the extent that we benefit financially, after all as lesser humans they are technically irrelevant
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 7:21 PM	No	Just more cogs to feed into the machine that is Quasi-Hispanic Inc.\LF(Headed by Connor mounts and Daniel Porada) 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 7:25 PM	Yes	Yes, it will be a pmc, and twenty years from now it will control the entire world
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 7:47 PM	No	Or we could have a company called Nuthin Butt Plugs and it can sell anal toys 
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 7:47 PM	No	(Nothing but plugs)
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 7:50 PM	Yes	I suppose that works as well, however we'd probably have to get someone from Yale involved
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 7:51 PM	No	Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 7:52 PM	No	Just for product testing, right?
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 7:56 PM	Yes	Of course, It's highly unlikely he'd have much else to contribute
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 7:56 PM	No	Aside from comedic relief when he opens his mouth to speak?
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 8:02 PM	Yes	I'm not sure I'll want to listen to him speak during product testing 
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	I'm sure we can hire someone to listen to him 
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 8:09 PM	Yes	Perhaps one of those rappers, I'm positive that they will be looking for jobs in just a few years
+17758154378	May 4, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	You mean after they've spent all of their money on gold teeths and by burning it with a lighter?
+17344782101	May 4, 2014, 8:21 PM	Yes	Correct
+17758154378	May 22, 2014, 11:00 AM	No	Are you working today?
+17344782101	May 22, 2014, 11:43 AM	Yes	No, why?
+17758154378	Jun 13, 2014, 8:37 AM	No	Happy birthday big daddy!
+17344782101	Jun 13, 2014, 11:25 AM	Yes	Thanks piata 
+17758154378	Jun 16, 2014, 10:42 PM	No	Jay says to tell you that he's not scared, whatever that means. 
+17758154378	Jun 16, 2014, 10:42 PM	No	Though the state he was in made it hard to tell if that was what he wanted me to say or not. 
+17758154378	Jun 16, 2014, 10:45 PM	No	He's asleep in the water.
+17758154378	Jun 16, 2014, 10:45 PM	No	And his phone will probably break soon as a result.
+17758154378	Jun 16, 2014, 10:48 PM	No	"And then\LF""Hoivcgikhoo to Cdsilk"""
+17758154378	Jun 16, 2014, 10:48 PM	No	Maybe that means something to you. 
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 10:04 AM	Yes	I know exactly what that means actually
+17758154378	Jul 18, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	You in town?
	Jul 18, 2014, 7:45 PM	Yes	No I'm in Bulgaria
+17344782101	Jul 18, 2014, 7:46 PM	Yes	No I'm in Bulgaria
+17344782101	Jul 18, 2014, 7:48 PM	Yes	And I'm fucked the fuck up
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 12:40 AM	Yes	What are y'all doing tonight?
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:41 AM	No	Evan Gabo and I just chilled and watched some TV 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:41 AM	No	I'm back home now
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:41 AM	No	How're you, cannon cock?
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 12:47 AM	Yes	Nice, since when do y'all hang out with Gabo? and haha my cock and I are great, you?
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:48 AM	No	We bumped into him at kimono randomly! 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:48 AM	No	You text really well drunk 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:48 AM	No	It's that ivy league education! Jay is incoherent 
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 12:49 AM	Yes	I was actually just about to make a deuchy remark along those lines
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:49 AM	No	Great minds thing alike my boy 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:50 AM	No	And we are clearly both great
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 12:51 AM	Yes	No doubt, is anyone in the Ivy League not? That's a dumb question actually, ofcourse not
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 12:53 AM	Yes	I think what I meant to say last night was\LFHoivcgikhoo to Cdsilk
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:53 AM	No	What does that mean?
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 12:55 AM	Yes	I think they are words of substantial wisdom, but you'd have to ask Jay, they are his
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:56 AM	No	He has no clue 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:56 AM	No	He was trying to sleep underwater
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:56 AM	No	I don't think substantial wisdom is his forte 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 12:56 AM	No	Particularly when inebriated 
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:02 AM	Yes	I think wisdom is everyone's forte when inebriated (which I am shocked to learn does not start with an e) most just struggle to articulate the complex thoughts the alcohol provides (thoughts like where's the pussy, or damn that bitch is probably ugly but right now she's fine as hell) and I think there are actually more organisms living and sleeping underwater than on land, he was just trying to fit in, you can't blame him for that 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:02 AM	No	While I am aware of the statistic you cite, the fact remains that the human respiratory system cannot in fact extract oxygen from water as many aquatic species can. Rather, it extracts pulmonary edema and rapid death due to oxygen loss. 
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:09 AM	Yes	"While you have a valid and very Ivy League sounding argument, you fail to consider the possibility that the Cavenaugh family has developed gills, which is probably what jay was trying to tell you when he said ""Hoivcgikhoo to Cdsilk"""
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:10 AM	Yes	"Which means ""don't worry about the fact that I'm sleeping in water, I have gills"""
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:11 AM	No	Ah, yes, I see now. But clearly spoken in Farsi, the traditional tongue of amphibious humanoids. You're brilliant.
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:13 AM	Yes	Precisely, did you know that while spoken underwater Farsi actually sounds identical to English?
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:13 AM	No	I thought that was only when you said it into a mirror and looked at the reflection of the air bubbles and then timed their ascent to the surface as compared to English? 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:17 AM	No	Your ability to formulate complete cogent sentences while wasted is incredible 
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:26 AM	Yes	Not particularly, your sentences are making me feel rather inadequate, and to be fair wasted would probably not be an accurate description at this point, some sleeping did happen between now and initial contact, also that's a dated method, scientist recently discovered that sound volume and volume are the same thing, therefor because Farsi is typically spoken more loudly than English, it is less dense, causing slight variations in ascent rates in water that caused significant confusion, and in three cases the transmission of communicable diseases including but not limited to herpes, aids, and the feminist perspective 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:26 AM	No	"So in short what you're saying is ""pussy so good it done turned a nigga soft?"" "
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:28 AM	Yes	I think so, but my Niggerian is rusty
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:28 AM	No	Their niggerian is rusty too. We socio-economically conquered them because they aren't capable of communicating with one another 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:28 AM	No	"The use of the word ""nigga"" does not a meaningful statement make, as they have found out all too well "
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:32 AM	Yes	But have they really found out? And yes, Niggerian and poor speaking skills are synonymous, but I figured the politically correct approach would be to blame my own capacity to remember, not to allocate responsibility to the ones who failed to develop a language with any degree of utility
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:32 AM	No	I think though that the approach that would perpetuate responsible stewardship would be to acknowledge the deficiencies of our...swarthier brethren and to give them meaningful jobs that they are capable of completing even with limited linguistic ability. For instance, I understand cotton plantations require very little communicative ability. 
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:47 AM	Yes	I don't think that it is possible for that to be said better, modified, or expanded upon, the logic is sound and the solution comprehensive
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:48 AM	No	Shall we implement this final solution posthaste?
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:50 AM	Yes	"Glancing at that message I thought the last word read ""toothpaste"", and undoubtedly"
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:51 AM	No	Yes, toothpaste also is critical if we are to keep the breath of the workers free of the scent of Popeye's chicken. 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:52 AM	No	"Though, as they are wont to say, ""I sure do luh me some Popeye's"" as well "
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:54 AM	Yes	We will actually use Popeyes only occasionally as an incentive, it is far more cost effective to have them produce and consume their own watermelon
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:54 AM	No	A brilliant plan, but whence will the red Kool-Aid come? 
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 1:56 AM	Yes	On even days, in an alternating pattern with purple drink, which will be served on odd days
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:56 AM	No	"Are you sure ""sippin on lean"" will not compromise the efficacy of our already dubiously motivated workforce? "
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 2:01 AM	Yes	No, but we must make certain sacrifices to prevent the evil and notoriously pesky notion of civil rights from entering their malleable minds, complacency is a beautiful thing
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 2:00 AM	No	"So we are agreed that committing a ""Rosa Parks"" is to be punishable by public and summary execution?"
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 2:05 AM	Yes	Yes, but such in occurrence is highly unlikely, with self sustaining watermelon farms allowing them to travel at all will be wholly unnecessary
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 2:04 AM	No	You again prove yourself to be as brilliant as you are well-endowed. Goodnight Connor! hahahaha this was the best conversation I've ever had 
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 2:19 AM	Yes	Haha this has been great, I admire the shit out of your lyrical talent, and am very glad we could do this, goodnight and thank you Daniel
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 2:21 AM	No	Also please look up Hollywood Hoes by Wiz Khalifa; I think it describes admirably the lifestyles we will have upon graduating college. I find it to be quite inspirational. 
+17344782101	Jul 19, 2014, 2:23 AM	Yes	Haha will do
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 7:54 PM	No	Did you look it up?
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 8:47 PM	No	Look Dan Bilzerian up on Instagram. He's what I imagine you'll be in 10 years 
+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 8:49 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jul 20, 2014, 7:15 AM	Yes	I suppose the songs pretty accurate, and haha I'm familiar, that man is living the dream, by the way his twitter is even better
+17758154378	Jul 20, 2014, 12:14 PM	No	Wow that is a lot of boos
+17758154378	Jul 20, 2014, 12:14 PM	No	Boobs
+17344782101	Jul 20, 2014, 12:56 PM	Yes	Haha yes, it is
+17758154378	Aug 13, 2014, 12:10 AM	No	Hey, can you bring my amplifier to waffle house tomorrow? 
+17758154378	Aug 17, 2014, 3:14 PM	No	I found a restaurant for us in New York 
+17344782101	Aug 17, 2014, 3:29 PM	Yes	I hope it's the one from the review you posted to the group, my mouth was watering the entire time
+17758154378	Aug 17, 2014, 3:31 PM	No	No no, this one got 3 Michelin stars; it's the third best restaurant in the world and the best in the United States 
+17344782101	Aug 17, 2014, 3:36 PM	Yes	Sounds good to me, how are we getting in? I'd imagine that reservations are made months if not years in advance
+17758154378	Aug 17, 2014, 3:38 PM	No	Yeah we'll have to make a reservation now probably for the spring 
+17344782101	Aug 17, 2014, 3:46 PM	Yes	I'm in, when do you head of to columbia?

+17344782101	Aug 17, 2014, 3:50 PM	Yes	Thursday, we should hang out some time before then
+17758154378	Aug 17, 2014, 3:50 PM	No	Yeah we should!

+17758154378	Aug 17, 2014, 4:20 PM	No	
+17758154378	Aug 17, 2014, 4:22 PM	No	We can eat there and then get dinner afterwards 
+17344782101	Aug 17, 2014, 4:30 PM	Yes	At affle house?
+17758154378	Aug 17, 2014, 4:32 PM	No	Absolutely

+17344782101	Aug 20, 2014, 2:48 PM	Yes	Yeah, but where do you get them? Online or is there a store here in the mall that carries them?
+17758154378	Aug 20, 2014, 2:48 PM	No	I got them at the tanger outlets but I think Belk or Macy's has them
+17344782101	Aug 20, 2014, 2:52 PM	Yes	Alright thanks
+17344782101	Sep 27, 2014, 3:22 PM	Yes	Porada, I know I already mentioned this, but wanted to consolidate plans, would you sill be good with me coming up some time during the 9th through the 12th of October, and if so which days would be best?

+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 12:22 PM	Yes	Hey, congrats on vanderbilt! Just out of curiosity why the post today? Wondering because I just recently heard back as well, am heading down there for mosaic weekend Thursday and was wondering if you might be as well?
+13365299141	Mar 8, 2014, 12:27 PM	No	Thanks, congrats to you too! I applied regular decision but found out last night because I got the Vanderbilt Scholarship. What's Mosaic Weekend? I haven't gotten my letter or anything yet so I'm a little behind I guess!
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 12:42 PM	Yes	That's awesome! And it's a multicultural student recruiting weekend, they let around 200 students know that they were admitted in early match and bring them in to try to get them to come, you heard back early as well so I thought that might be why, but it's not nearly as exciting as getting the scholarship, congrats again!
+13365299141	Mar 8, 2014, 12:47 PM	No	Ohhh well that sounds awesome! Do you think you'll go there?
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 12:54 PM	Yes	It depends, I like the idea of being in Nashville but I've never actually been, and there is only one school I would automatically take over it and it's a long shot, so there's definitely a chance, you been at class lately?
+13365299141	Mar 8, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	Nashville's amazing! Where would you go instead? Almost every one!
+13365299141	Mar 8, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	You should come back!
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 8:08 PM	Yes	I think I'm going to starting next week, I've been playing two sports the last couple months and so couldn't make it, and Stanford
+13365299141	Mar 8, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	Ohh well yay that'll be fun! I'm so obsessed with it haha. Ahh that would be so cool

+13367757093	Mar 8, 2014, 1:22 PM	No	Can't we just get them there?
+17344782101	Mar 8, 2014, 1:27 PM	Yes	Apparently it saves time if you do it online, my mom said shed just do it for you and have y'all pay her the ten bucks later
+13367757093	Mar 8, 2014, 1:27 PM	No	Ok sounds good to me 
+13364086079	Mar 8, 2014, 1:27 PM	No	Oh okay yeah that works

+13362621938	Mar 13, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Btw how did you hear back so early?
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 8:16 PM	Yes	Thanks, I broke the vandy rd curse, and because I got invited to mosaic weekend, which is vandys multicultural student recruiting weekend
+13362621938	Mar 13, 2014, 8:16 PM	No	Hahahahahaha
+13362621938	Mar 13, 2014, 8:17 PM	No	That's just too much
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 8:17 PM	Yes	Haha I know
+13362621938	Mar 13, 2014, 8:17 PM	No	You're so multicultural 
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 8:17 PM	Yes	It's me and a bunch of black kids
+13362621938	Mar 13, 2014, 8:17 PM	No	You'll fit right in
+13362621938	Mar 13, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	Also, Vandy isn't diverse at all
+13362621938	Mar 13, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	Like literally no Asians
+13362621938	Mar 13, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	Besides Hayes' roommate 
+13362621938	Mar 13, 2014, 8:18 PM	No	And me when I was there
+17344782101	Mar 13, 2014, 8:28 PM	Yes	Haha all of that is so true
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	Connski you need to just decide to go to duke
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	Literally everywhere else sucks, I promise
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 7:40 PM	Yes	Your right
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	I mean think about it... It's Bradley or me 
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	Or if you get in Stanford, such separation 
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	Our relationship can't endure that
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 7:46 PM	Yes	Our relationship will endure Faw, and haha I'm not into Princeton yet
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	It better. But thinking about it, I know of like 2 or 3 Hispanic people at Duke, so I'd say you're pretty set
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:12 PM	Yes	Haha I don't know, everyone smart applied to duke this year
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Don't let mrs. Hogan freak you out dude
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:17 PM	Yes	I'm not, the vandy lady said they don't make decisions based on school yield, so when chase and Bradley didn't get in it's just because they didn't make the cut
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:17 PM	Yes	So I feel pretty decent about my chances
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 8:21 PM	No	Idk, I feel like that could just be the politically correct answer, but you never know
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:22 PM	Yes	Even if it is, my ethnicity still made me appealing enough to admit, something that neither of them were
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	Everyone already knows you're ber appealing sooo ;)
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	Btw have you and Hayes gone to any mad ragers yet?
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:28 PM	Yes	;) no I met up with him last night but was too tired to go out with him
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	Bummer...
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	When you get into Duke you need to come visit me againnnnn
+13362621938	Mar 14, 2014, 8:31 PM	No	Like during blue devil days or something
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 8:33 PM	Yes	If I get into duke, and it doesn't conflict with anything else, I'll be there
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 4:16 PM	Yes	Fawwwww
+13362621938	Mar 18, 2014, 6:10 PM	No	Connskiiiiii
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 6:13 PM	Yes	I want to be in college
+13362621938	Mar 18, 2014, 6:16 PM	No	You'll be here soon enough 
+13362621938	Mar 18, 2014, 6:16 PM	No	And you better be here 
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 6:28 PM	Yes	Haha Faw me getting into duke is a very generous assumption, everyone who applied this year is smart as shit
+13362621938	Mar 18, 2014, 6:28 PM	No	Haha according to what?
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 6:36 PM	Yes	Haha according to me
+13362621938	Mar 18, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	If you're basing your info off of college confidential, you're worrying yourself too much
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 6:47 PM	Yes	Haha I'm not, I'm basing it off the kids at the vandy admit weekend
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 6:47 PM	Yes	Most of them made me look stupid
+17344782101	Mar 18, 2014, 6:47 PM	Yes	And completely unaccomplished
+17344782101	Mar 19, 2014, 6:23 PM	Yes	What are you doing this Friday?
+17344782101	Mar 19, 2014, 9:36 PM	Yes	Fooooo
+13362621938	Mar 19, 2014, 9:37 PM	No	Not sure. Why?

+17344782101	Mar 19, 2014, 11:31 PM	Yes	Really if your busy I don't have to come
+13362621938	Mar 19, 2014, 11:31 PM	No	When are you coming?
+17344782101	Mar 19, 2014, 11:32 PM	Yes	I think the thing gets out around 4ish, I'd probably head straight to duke from there
+13362621938	Mar 19, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	I could definitely hang out for a while, but I might need to be somewhere at 5:30, but that's not for sure
+17344782101	Mar 19, 2014, 11:35 PM	Yes	That be sweet, and I could go walk around the campus during your 530 thing, I've never actually seen any of it except your room and the slg that we went to
+13362621938	Mar 19, 2014, 11:49 PM	No	I can't wait <3
+17344782101	Mar 19, 2014, 11:55 PM	Yes	:) <3 entirely your call and I am very happy with either, but is this a dinner date or am I spending the night?
+13362621938	Mar 20, 2014, 12:37 AM	No	Ok so I have something on west that will probably last from 5:30 to 6:30, but we can get dinner after that and then hang out. And it's up to you 
+17344782101	Mar 20, 2014, 12:49 AM	Yes	Dinner and hang out for a bit sounds great, can't wait  <3
+17344782101	Mar 21, 2014, 3:29 PM	Yes	What you doing?
+13362621938	Mar 21, 2014, 3:29 PM	No	I'm just outside of the Bryan center on west
+13362621938	Mar 21, 2014, 3:29 PM	No	Are you here?
+17344782101	Mar 21, 2014, 3:37 PM	Yes	No I'm leaving soon

+13362621938	Mar 21, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	Ok walking to whole foods
+17344782101	Mar 24, 2014, 7:26 PM	Yes	I don't think I got into duke man, their email about notification date is very foreboding
+13362621938	Mar 24, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	Wouldn't they send that email to everyone?
+17344782101	Mar 24, 2014, 7:28 PM	Yes	I think it's the one they sent to everyone, but the first time they sent me the email it bounced, so this particular email did not go to everyone
+13362621938	Mar 24, 2014, 7:30 PM	No	What do you mean it bounced?
+13362621938	Mar 24, 2014, 7:30 PM	No	Also when do you find out?
+17344782101	Mar 24, 2014, 7:31 PM	Yes	Duke said the email would not go through the first time they sent it, and Thursday, from everyone except Stanford I think
+13362621938	Mar 24, 2014, 7:41 PM	No	Oh fun
+13362621938	Mar 24, 2014, 7:41 PM	No	Good luck d00d
+17344782101	Mar 24, 2014, 8:09 PM	Yes	Thanks foo, ima need it

+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 5:49 PM	Yes	Tomorrow at 6, I'm not to optimistic though, stanford had twice as many applicants as princeton
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 5:49 PM	Yes	And thanks!
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 6:00 PM	Yes	Wait listed at Harvard
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 6:00 PM	No	What about dukeeeee
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 6:00 PM	No	Ughhh I can't stand the anticipation

+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	Ugh whyyyy
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	I will forever hate duke if you don't get in
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 6:34 PM	Yes	Haha I'm really not sure
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 7:04 PM	Yes	I didn't get in
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 7:05 PM	No	What?
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 7:05 PM	No	I hate everything
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 7:07 PM	Yes	Looks like I'm going to Wharton foo
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 7:07 PM	No	Ugh
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 7:07 PM	No	Not even wait listed?
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 7:07 PM	Yes	Wait listed
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 7:15 PM	Yes	Evan Thomason got wait listed as well, I don't know what the fuck happened
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 7:15 PM	No	Oh wow that's crazy 
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 7:15 PM	No	I don't understand
+13362621938	Mar 27, 2014, 7:16 PM	No	Did anyone from FCDS get in?
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 7:19 PM	Yes	I don't know, I'll probably find out tomorrow, this is ridiculous
+17344782101	Mar 27, 2014, 7:32 PM	Yes	Evan Thomason is a legacy to
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 10:52 AM	Yes	Caroline Hubble is the only one who got in, 3 kids on the waitlist
+13362621938	Mar 28, 2014, 11:28 AM	No	What?!
+13362621938	Mar 28, 2014, 11:28 AM	No	Who else is waitlisted?
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 11:35 AM	Yes	Evan Thomason, and jay Doherty, y'all took all the Forsyth spots last year
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 11:36 AM	Yes	Lorna called duke and they said I had a good chance of getting in of the waitlist
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 11:36 AM	Yes	But wharton is the best school for what I am doing, so there really isn't a point
+13362621938	Mar 28, 2014, 11:57 AM	No	Yeah for sure. I can't believe you guys didn't get in though. But who knows, you still have a chance at Stanford 
+13362621938	Mar 28, 2014, 11:57 AM	No	Where do Evan and jay think he's going?
+13362621938	Mar 28, 2014, 11:57 AM	No	*they're
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 12:03 PM	Yes	They are both pursuing the duke waitlist, so one of them will probably end up there
+13362621938	Mar 28, 2014, 12:02 PM	No	Would you consider the going for Harvard?
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 12:06 PM	Yes	Lorna called Harvard duke and columbia for me, her email to me was only about columbia and duke
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 12:06 PM	Yes	So I would but I don't think I have a shot
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 12:07 PM	Yes	And no stanford wait list because it has a 0% yield
+13362621938	Mar 28, 2014, 12:23 PM	No	Oh ok, well even though you won't be with me, penn's still a great place and perfect for what you want to do 
+13362621938	Mar 28, 2014, 12:23 PM	No	:(
+17344782101	Mar 28, 2014, 12:31 PM	Yes	Thanks foo, love you

+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 2:29 PM	Yes	Much better now that I've been properly congratulated :)
+13362621938	May 31, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	Niceeee you should come visit me at Duke dude, summer school is boring
+13362621938	May 31, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	And I miss you dearly
+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 7:23 PM	Yes	I miss you too, I should be able to do that actually, getting my private pilot certification and I need the flight hours
+13362621938	May 31, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	Whattt that's sick dude have you soloed yet?
+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 8:06 PM	Yes	Haha no, I just started, and I think Ima take a little longer than most because I get pretty bad motion sickness
+13362621938	May 31, 2014, 8:49 PM	No	Yeah the first few lessons made me kind of sick on my stomach, but you'll get get over it pretty quickly. When did you start?
+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 9:58 PM	Yes	That's good to hear, and two weeks ago, but I didn't make any progress this past week because it was too busy with graduation and such
+13362621938	May 31, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	Gotcha. What else do you have planned for the summer?
+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 10:52 PM	Yes	Beach week, wedding in Europe, and working on some projects, why are you at summer school Faw?
+13362621938	Jun 1, 2014, 1:15 AM	No	I needed to take a class to switch into Pratt, plus I'm doing research
+17344782101	Jun 3, 2014, 12:23 AM	Yes	No more trinitard for Faw, what class? And research on?

+13367037963	Mar 14, 2014, 9:13 PM	No	Yes.
+17344782101	Mar 14, 2014, 11:34 PM	Yes	Made it back to the room, I think the pepto is working

+13365294231	Mar 15, 2014, 4:11 PM	No	No sry bud I can't I have to be somewhere at 7:00
+13368165198	Mar 15, 2014, 4:12 PM	No	David wants to
+13366959263	Mar 15, 2014, 4:12 PM	No	Not Jay?
+13368165198	Mar 15, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	
+13366959263	Mar 15, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	Darn Adam, haven't hiked with you in forever 
+13366959263	Mar 15, 2014, 4:14 PM	No	You kidding me?
+13366959263	Mar 15, 2014, 4:14 PM	No	I'm gonna cut your rocking fingers off
+13364068233	Mar 15, 2014, 4:16 PM	No	Watching basketball bro
+13366959263	Mar 15, 2014, 4:16 PM	No	Who does that?
+13364036025	Mar 15, 2014, 4:17 PM	No	Everyone in America 
+13366959263	Mar 15, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	So Avery's coming?
+17344782101	Mar 17, 2014, 12:00 AM	Yes	Is their a vocab quiz tomorrow?
+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 6:57 PM	Yes	What do I need to know tomorrow that I probably forgot?
+13363415124	May 5, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	I'm not sure. 2d arrays? I feel like most of the questions will be fairly straightforward, or just annoying logic questions
+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 7:03 PM	Yes	What would I do without you jay? Brian says your good to start Wednesday?
+13363415124	May 5, 2014, 7:04 PM	No	Yeah. I figure I don't need to study tons for English, plus I'm still not entirely clear on what I'm gonna be doing, so starting early is fine by me
+17344782101	May 5, 2014, 7:12 PM	Yes	I'm excited, I think it will be pretty interesting
+13363415124	May 18, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	Have you actually managed to make a chart out of JSON data? I feel like I'm really close but I've gotten stuck
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 6:07 PM	Yes	Yes, but not in the current format I had to tweak it a little, you assign the data to an object and then each of the pieces can be accessed as instance variables of that object, I'll show you tomorrow 
+13363415124	May 18, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	Ok that makes sense, and I think maybe my way was failing because the data is not incased in an object to begin with. Basically, I think I could make it work if I had server-side access, but you'll have to show me how to do it client-side
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 6:30 PM	Yes	Okay, we should be able to make a pretty serious dent tomorrow
+13363415124	May 18, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	Sounds good
+17344782101	May 21, 2014, 7:29 PM	Yes	Hey can you send me a copy of the group hours?

+13363415124	May 21, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	I think that's everything 
+17344782101	May 21, 2014, 7:40 PM	Yes	Thanks man, are you not counting lunch? And I'm good during the day Friday, and any time Saturday and Sunday to finish the project, when is best for you?
+13363415124	May 21, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	I'm not sure about lunch, we need to decide that as a group. I'm free all weekend, so we might as well start on Friday so we have plenty of time
+17344782101	May 21, 2014, 7:43 PM	Yes	Sounds good
+13363415124	May 23, 2014, 12:06 PM	No	Um I'm here but I don't know how to use your doorbell
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 6:22 PM	Yes	Do you have any time to get together in the next couple days?
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 6:30 PM	Yes	Also can you send me the code for rendering scatter and bar charts?
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 6:48 PM	No	Yeah I'm free most mornings and afternoons for the next couple of days
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	And I just sent you an email with the code I've been giving to Eric and Brian
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 6:51 PM	Yes	Sweet, when would be the best time for you to meet up?
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	Maybe tomorrow afternoon?
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 6:59 PM	Yes	What time in the afternoon? I have a family dinner around 6
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	That's fine, maybe we could meet around 1:30? I need a little bit of time in the morning so I can't go much earlier
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 7:02 PM	Yes	Yeah that works
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	Ok sounds good
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	Oh, is meeting at your house still good?
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 7:06 PM	Yes	Yeah
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 7:10 PM	Yes	I made some sweet changes by the way
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 7:11 PM	No	Nice. I fixed one issue that I want to show you tomorrow
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 7:11 PM	No	But it's pretty minor
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 7:13 PM	Yes	Okay
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 7:14 PM	Yes	I think I found a solution to the error I was getting when the parse app decided to be dumb and not load data that is suppose to be there
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 7:17 PM	No	Ok  brands/OffersByBrand is still broken because that part of the API never got updated to the new standards 
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 7:19 PM	Yes	Yeah I haven't bothered with that one
+13363415124	May 26, 2014, 1:08 PM	No	I'm running a little late, but I should be at your house by 1:45 at the latest
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 1:10 PM	Yes	Okay
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 6:48 PM	Yes	I fixed the data load method. It now takes an array as a param and runs recursively. I have it set to a maximum of ten attempts before alerting the user about how many pages failed to load and generating the graph with what it has, still have no idea why that error comes up in the first place.
+13363415124	May 26, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	Alright well that's much better at least
+17344782101	May 26, 2014, 6:50 PM	Yes	Yeah I also just realized that scatter needs to be taken out of the options when there is no x axis for the data
+13363415124	May 26, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	Oh yeah good point
+17344781254	Mar 18, 2014, 11:39 AM	No	Do you want chick filet
+17344781253	Mar 18, 2014, 11:40 AM	No	Nah I'm not hungry

+13367757093	May 18, 2014, 6:15 PM	No	Don't do it, somehow it'll break your game
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 6:16 PM	No	that's awesome!
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 6:17 PM	No	Yeah but don't you want all the shapes for world one already loaded in? 
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 6:19 PM	No	what do you mean? like adding it as a child? 
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 6:19 PM	Yes	Eventually, but I don't need that to start
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 6:22 PM	No	You will have to recreate the puzzles if we don't have the exact shapes(images that Gabo makes) because the physics bodies will be different 
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 6:22 PM	No	But I can send it to you still if you want 
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 6:23 PM	Yes	Shit yeah, I forgot about that, I'll wait
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 6:25 PM	No	what shapes do you want?
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 6:25 PM	No	I can make them in 10 min
+13367757093	May 18, 2014, 6:25 PM	No	Penises
+13367757093	May 18, 2014, 6:25 PM	No	I can make em in 9 min
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 6:25 PM	No	I think Conner wants rectangles as thin as his penis 
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 6:26 PM	No	But I don't know what lengths he wants 
+13367757093	May 18, 2014, 6:26 PM	No	Same size, 2 inch
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 6:26 PM	No	he likes them small remember?
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 6:29 PM	Yes	Same width, one half length and one double length of the original
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 6:30 PM	No	all blue?
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 6:34 PM	Yes	For the first world yeah, but well want pieces like that in all of the colors eventually
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	What's the title going to be and Gabo can you make the setting and world 1 buttons  
+13367757093	May 18, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	Title- pussypounder
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	That's golden 
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	yeah I can make the setting and cool ass buttons
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	we need to brainstorm a title
+13367757093	May 18, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	What's the concept, I'll get you a good name
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 8:02 PM	No	It's the level one button 
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 8:02 PM	No	only programmers get to pick the title
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 8:02 PM	Yes	Well brainstorm it at the next pp, we don't need it right now
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 8:02 PM	No	Okay sounds good
+17046570257	May 18, 2014, 8:03 PM	No	But we need an icon for each level 
+17344782101	May 18, 2014, 8:03 PM	Yes	Roman numerals and titles for the worlds
+13367458849	May 18, 2014, 8:03 PM	No	I'll work on it
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	PP tonight at my house 9:15
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	we are signing  a contract 
+17344782101	May 19, 2014, 4:58 PM	Yes	Contract for?
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 4:58 PM	No	For no bullshit to happen in the future. If we are all going to invest our time and money into this project we all need to be committed 
+13367757093	May 19, 2014, 6:00 PM	No	I'll be there 
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 8:25 PM	No	I'll be a little late so make it 9:30 ;$

+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	Pp is cancelled
+13367757093	May 19, 2014, 9:24 PM	No	What?
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:29 PM	No	Look at the number one free app on the App Store 
+17344782101	May 20, 2014, 1:30 PM	Yes	What about it?
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:30 PM	No	So freaking awesome but simple 
+13367458849	May 20, 2014, 1:31 PM	No	our game will not be free though
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:31 PM	No	I think Maybe we should do free with adds 
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:31 PM	No	Ads 
+13367458849	May 20, 2014, 1:31 PM	No	we could do both...
+17344782101	May 20, 2014, 1:32 PM	Yes	Ads will fuck up our gameplay
+17344782101	May 20, 2014, 1:32 PM	Yes	Freemium model, first couple levels are free and then you buy the whole app
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	Golden 
+13367458849	May 20, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	which makes the programming harder
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	It will take too second 
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	Seconds 
+17344782101	May 20, 2014, 1:34 PM	Yes	It's not about making the programming easy, it's about providing a good experience and monetizing the app the best way possible
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	Anyways I have plenty of time. We have zero puzzles 
+17344782101	May 20, 2014, 1:34 PM	Yes	Haha get me my test materials and I'll pump out the levels
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:35 PM	No	We need to have a pp after our interns because we need to talk about that 
+17046570257	May 20, 2014, 1:35 PM	No	What shapes/abilities do you need for world one 
+17344782101	May 20, 2014, 1:36 PM	Yes	Okay, no abilities world one, and just my lines, half, regular and double length, I can rotate them as needed but for world one that's it

+17046570257	Apr 18, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	Because you didn't response 
+17046570257	Apr 18, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	Respond 
+13367458849	Apr 18, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	I've been playing it too
+17344782101	Apr 18, 2014, 10:32 PM	Yes	Fair enough, let me know next time, I'm very down to play
+17046570257	Apr 18, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	Okay sounds good babe 
+17344782101	May 19, 2014, 5:01 PM	Yes	Sounds good, do you have one written up, or would you like me to draft one for us to finalize tonight?
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 5:00 PM	No	we are all writing it together
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 5:00 PM	No	it's not going to be a very complicated or long contract
+17344782101	May 19, 2014, 5:03 PM	Yes	That's what finalize means, I was just going to put in the basics, places to sign, etc. that way all we'd have to do is customize
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 5:04 PM	No	alright
+17046570257	May 19, 2014, 5:04 PM	No	Okay 
+17344782101	May 19, 2014, 5:04 PM	Yes	Also I have my internship at 8 tomorrow morning so I can't stay super late
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 5:05 PM	No	that's fine, you can leave once we all sign the contract 
+17344782101	May 19, 2014, 7:27 PM	Yes	Hey I don't really want to drive an hour just to sign something, I can PP any or every night starting Thursday though, can we do it then?
+17344782101	May 19, 2014, 7:28 PM	Yes	And by Thursday I mean Friday 
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 7:28 PM	No	we need you to sign this
+17344782101	May 19, 2014, 7:30 PM	Yes	I will, but I just don't see why it has to be tonight
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 7:32 PM	No	because we need to make everything clear
+17344782101	May 19, 2014, 7:38 PM	Yes	I agree, we definitely do, but waiting till this weekend won't kill us
+13367458849	May 19, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	fine
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 10:16 PM	Yes	I sent an email to your school accounts with an attached agreement. Please review the agreement, and let me know as soon as possible if you will agree to sign it.
+13367458849	May 25, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	I'm not signing that
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 10:35 PM	Yes	Please specify the component that would need to be modified for you to find the document agreeable
+17046570257	May 25, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	The fact that you are willing to give up your shares of lykos that quickly just proves that you are not committed. That is one of many reasons I don't want to work with you, and I don't want your shitty company.  
+13367458849	May 25, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	I agree, you are just using us. We do all the work and you will still get recognize for it 
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 10:37 PM	Yes	I am willing to give up my shares because I don't want to work with people I don't trust, it has nothing to do with commitment. Second the company is a favor noble, lykos was Gabo's idea and it will save you guys a lot of money in filing fees to use it instead of forming another.
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 10:39 PM	Yes	Was the idea not mine? Did you or did you not lie to me about working on the project? Did you ignore my attempts to help?
+17046570257	May 25, 2014, 10:42 PM	No	I don't need any favors from you, and perfect we both agree we don't want to work with each other. I'm just creating an app in my free time and don't plan on jumping into a company without a product. 
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 10:43 PM	Yes	An app for which I came up with the idea, no?
+13367458849	May 25, 2014, 10:53 PM	No	Let's set everything straight. I came to you last summer to make an app together. We both started to learn the language and working together to form quick fix. You convinced me to form a company ( Lykos was your idea) we were delayed about 6 months because of the company and company account. All we did was waste money and time on a company that did not even have a product. Since quick fix was delayed I started working on Golfkit. which I worked on all by myself with no help received from you. You decided to focus on learning web design and android to expand the company, which turned out to be shit because you did not learn android development and the website was horrible. Then when you finally decided to help me you messed up golfkit's code and delayed its release even more. You messed up so badly that I haven't been able to fix it. Then I started to learn sprite kit and released Atomic Dodge all on my own because you were unable to help since you did not know the language.  I released atomic dodge under Lykos and you got credit for something that you did not do or create. I am not going to go through same thing again. That is why we don't want to work with you. You are the one that cannot be trusted. I am sorry Connor. It is not personal but the past and your character is the reason why we don't want to work with you. You have proven to be unreliable and willing to use people to achieve your goals 
+17344782101	May 25, 2014, 11:04 PM	Yes	Whether or not we want to work together is a non issue, I will not dispute that I have not been as committed as you, but the fact remains that this game was my idea, and I shared it with you with every intention of developing it together, both of you know this to be true, and in regards to this particular case everything else is irrelevant. I am asking a pittance, 10% is nothing, and it does not even go to me, the remainder of the contract exists purely to ensure that the contract is not violated and that we are no longer associated, something clearly necessary as there is no trust here. If removing my name from the donations so that I do not receive any credit will make the contract agreeable I would be willing to modify it in that way
+17046570257	May 25, 2014, 11:07 PM	No	I don't agree with what you are saying and I'm not signing any piece of paper with you 
+17344782101	Mar 31, 2014, 5:31 PM	Yes	Inmar on Thursday, jay I know you're gone 
+13368165198	Mar 31, 2014, 6:21 PM	No	Damnit
+13364148152	Apr 2, 2014, 3:37 PM	No	Come to lounge when you're done
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 3:37 PM	Yes	Okay
+13364148152	Apr 2, 2014, 3:39 PM	No	Actually parking lot
+17344782101	Apr 2, 2014, 3:41 PM	Yes	Okay
+13364148152	Apr 2, 2014, 3:50 PM	No	Wanna see if we can just lift here?

+17344782101	Apr 6, 2014, 6:17 PM	Yes	Quick question, do I need any formal clothes for Quaker days or is it all casual?
+19199351367	Apr 6, 2014, 6:57 PM	No	All casual I think. I don't know much about it tbh
+19199351367	Apr 6, 2014, 6:57 PM	No	But definitely all casual
+19199351367	Apr 6, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	I you get a schedule, email it to me because Id like to know when you're gonna be free/when I can do my thing haha
+17344782101	Apr 6, 2014, 9:12 PM	Yes	Haha alright, there is actually a Quaker days app with a schedule, but it is kind of ambiguous and I'm not sure you'll be able to access it
+17344782101	Apr 6, 2014, 9:22 PM	Yes	Do I need to bring a sleeping bag?
+19199351367	Apr 6, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	Yea that would be convenient. I have one, but I'm sure your more comfortable with yours. 
+19199351367	Apr 6, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	Do you mind looking at the app and telling me when you have free time/ when I come into the picture? Haha 
+19199351367	Apr 6, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	Also when do you head home? Tuesday?
+17344782101	Apr 6, 2014, 10:30 PM	Yes	Early Wednesday morning, and I think there is programming throughout the day both Monday and Tuesday, but the schedule contains every event that is taking place, I have no idea what I'm actually suppose to attend, it does say I am suppose to meet up with you some time after noon on Monday 
+19199351367	Apr 6, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	Ok. So from 12-1:30 I'm grabbing lunch that you can join. At 1:30-3, I have class, and you can come to that as well. From 3-6 I'm busy tomorrow. At 6, I'm going to a dinner speaker series that you can attend
+19199351367	Apr 6, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	And then I'm chilling
+19199351367	Apr 6, 2014, 10:37 PM	No	/doing Hwk. So lmk tomorrow

+19199351367	Apr 7, 2014, 10:17 AM	No	So I hope you made it to campus safely. I am headed to class. I have class til noon and then I am getting lunch at noon at a dining hall called 1920 Commons. If you need me to come get you before lunch let me know, but it's pretty easy to find on google/if you ask anyone. Also if you have another lunch option, choose that because this is a mediocre dining hall, and I'm just going because its a close location to my class haha
+17344782101	Apr 7, 2014, 10:21 AM	Yes	Haha alright, I am on the train now, I will text you my lunch plans around noon
+19199351367	Apr 7, 2014, 10:28 AM	No	Perfect. I also have class at 1:30pm in Huntsman Hall room 370. Unfortunately everyone is giving interim presentations on their group project, so it will be boring but you're welcome to come to that!

+13363411160	Apr 14, 2014, 9:04 PM	No	I'm asking because my dad works out of state and he wants to get a job back home here in Winston (he is gone during the week) and he said tonight at dinner that he applied for a project manager position at inmar

+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 2:54 PM	No	Ivy League*
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 3:20 PM	No	I kind of want to continue our conversation
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 3:20 PM	No	I found it titillating  
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 3:21 PM	Yes	I have to pack for a bit but  am free later
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 5:19 PM	No	Do you boys think love has any role in the creation of meaning in one's life? 
+13363914954	Aug 19, 2014, 5:24 PM	No	That's what the book I have to read is about!!!!!
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 5:30 PM	Yes	And the book says?
+13363914954	Aug 19, 2014, 6:24 PM	No	
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	But what's your opinion?
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 8:52 PM	Yes	Mine is yes, from a religious perspective it's the fact that god loves us that makes life meaningful, if he didn't we'd all be fucked anyways and nothing would matter. From a secular viewpoint it helps us to define where, who from, and in what we derive happiness and other positive emotion, either way it definitely plays a part.
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 8:54 PM	Yes	On a side note, text messages are not really conducive to this sort of discussion.
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 8:54 PM	No	That is very true 
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 8:54 PM	No	And is also disappointing as I really enjoyed it 
+13363914954	Aug 19, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	I think the only 'meaning' that humans can create in life is meaning that is limited by the scope of humanity's perception of the universe. Humans can't create any universal meaning because they can only experience things through the lens of human perspective
+13363914954	Aug 19, 2014, 8:56 PM	No	That's why people feel the need to create a god for themselves. Deep down, they know that they can't truly uncover universal meaning so they make up a being to be a catch-all for everything they can't understand
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 8:56 PM	No	I'm not referring to universal meaning, nor am I seeking it
+13363914954	Aug 19, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	Awkward, I didn't mean for that to be a direct rebuttal to connor's text. I didn't see Connor's text until after I wrote that
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 8:57 PM	Yes	Daniel it's not disappointing if it acts as an incentive to meet up more frequently
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	I'm seeking to find a purpose in life haha right now all I have is the motivation to get even with our classmates at FCDS by being wildly successful 
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 8:57 PM	Yes	And I think our intended meanings are less in conflict than you might think Eric
+13363914954	Aug 19, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	I think meaning and purpose are the same thing? ie 'to act with meaning' vs 'to act with purpose'
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 8:59 PM	No	"I would just propose the more narrowly defined question how important to your overall happiness is finding what people refer to as ""true love?"" "
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 9:00 PM	Yes	Eric I actually agree with what you said, my statement was more about the role love plays in the efficacy of a god figure
+13363914954	Aug 19, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	It's crazy we take 'faith' in stride. Try replacing 'god' with some other word and say the same things that 'god' does. The word 'god' has been given this reverence that requires us to accept its 'actions' even when they break every rule of our perception, only because we are 'expected' to have illogical faith as part of our personalities 
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	Are we discussing semantics or beliefs? 
+13363914954	Aug 19, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	That was just a musing that popped into my head
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	I think it's crazy that we accept that faith and science are inherently in opposition. If you genuinely believe that science is just an explanation for how god did it then is faith really illogical?
+13363914954	Aug 19, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	No I'm not saying faith and science are inherently at odds. I do think science and the Christian telling of origin are at odds
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	What if we use the bible as an allegorical telling rather than a literal text?
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 9:28 PM	No	In such a case science and faith line up remarkably well and compliment one another. Faith provides the  morality and the humanistic element of origin that science lacks
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 9:40 PM	Yes	To say that faith is illogical somewhat implies that it is at odds with science. And you dont even have to take it allegorically actually. As Eric stated earlier we are only capable of seeing things from our perspective, the words and concepts to describe what we now understand to be the origin of the universe didnt exist when the bible was written, and as an extreme simplification of the progression from nothing to humanity, genesis is actually a pretty apt description.
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	But you do believe in the bible literally?
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 10:44 PM	Yes	I believe that the bible is written exactly as events and instructions were perceived, but that I live in a different context
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	You think the bible is the literal word of god though? 
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 10:52 PM	Yes	Yes, but an imperfect translation of purpose that we cannot comprehend
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	Okay, but in that case why hasn't he communicated with anyone in the last thousand or so years?
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 10:57 PM	No	I'm not challenging, I'm just curious what your opinion is
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 10:57 PM	No	And how do you account for things like Islam, with god having given very clearly contradictory instructions in a nearly identical scenario to that described by moses 
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 11:01 PM	Yes	I know, and I will concede that I have no answer for your second question and that my response to the first is merely an opinion. In Eden everyone went to heaven, we chose to leave, for a while he communicated via great works, we ignored him, ultimately I think he does still communicate with us, just that his methods involve significant subtlety and that most people choose to ignore them.
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	So do you think Islam has as much validity as Christianity? What about Judaism? 
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 11:14 PM	Yes	No, both lack the Jesus component. The existence of a god only creates meaning for us if he loves us and acts in accordance with that love, Jesus is the manifestation and proof of that love. An all knowing being would have to recognize this, and require that we recognize it as well.
+17758154378	Aug 19, 2014, 11:16 PM	No	But you do realize that Judaism and Christianity are fundamentally the same religion, doctrinally? Which Christian denomination are you?
+17344782101	Aug 19, 2014, 11:35 PM	Yes	Yes, I specifically added that last line to differentiate them, and non-denominational
+17758154378	Aug 20, 2014, 10:57 PM	No	I just realized that we don't fit the typical smart kid Ivy League type at all 
+17758154378	Aug 20, 2014, 10:57 PM	No	Which is weird since probability would dictate that at least one of us would have to match the stereotype 
+17758154378	Aug 20, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	Especially Eric - you don't fit the typical computer programmer at all, I'm not a typical orchestra dork, and Connor isn't a typical 28476 AP taking student 
+17344782101	Aug 20, 2014, 10:59 PM	Yes	Are you trying to say that we don't belong because we have social skills?
+17758154378	Aug 20, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	Yeah basically and we're all athletic and attractive 
+17758154378	Aug 20, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	Not to blow our own horn 
+13363914954	Aug 20, 2014, 11:30 PM	No	I expect you to get your horn blown plenty
+17758154378	Aug 20, 2014, 11:31 PM	No	Yeah why blow my own when there's Barnard College and NYU?
+17344782101	Aug 20, 2014, 11:38 PM	Yes	Are you referring to the women of NYU or the incredibly disproportionate gay community?
+17758154378	Aug 20, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	Any port in a storm Connor
+17758154378	Aug 20, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	Even if that port has a beard and wears eyeliner 
+13363914954	Aug 21, 2014, 12:39 AM	No	Fucking ISIS makes me so fucking mad
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:39 AM	No	Yeah they need to take the hint and kill themselves so they can enjoy an eternity of torment 
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 12:41 AM	Yes	Yeah never really understood how people rationalized being so shitty
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:42 AM	No	At least I can use them as part of a pickup line
+13363914954	Aug 21, 2014, 12:42 AM	No	Oh please don't
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:42 AM	No	Hey babe, wanna have sex? If die a virgin, the guys from ISIS will get you for eternity...
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:42 AM	No	If ^you
+13363914954	Aug 21, 2014, 12:42 AM	No	Not funny!
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:42 AM	No	So funny
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:43 AM	No	It's worked 14 times already
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:44 AM	No	In all seriousness I think they've voided their right to treatment as human beings 
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 12:45 AM	Yes	^ unfortunately their use of civilian shields prevents us from blowing them all up
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:45 AM	No	I think we should proceed without regard for civilian casualties 
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:46 AM	No	I have no moral qualms about sublimating the good of a few people for the greater purpose of having the US destroy ISIS 
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 1:01 AM	Yes	I wouldn't go quite that far, the US should destroy ISIS whatever it takes, but every possible effort to conserve civilian lives ought to be made, and that has as much to do with protecting the reputation of the US as being morally obligate
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 1:02 AM	No	My moral code is limited to things that directly deal with my lifestyle choices, so were I to become president I wouldn't have any reservations about it 
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 1:02 AM	No	Which is a bit Machiavellian but hey, whatever cooks the goose 
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 1:07 AM	Yes	Do you think ISIS will attempt to attack US citizens in the states in the near future?
+13363914954	Aug 21, 2014, 12:23 PM	No	That would be some call of duty status shit
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 12:27 PM	No	What Eric means is if it does happen, he'll have his akimbo AA12s ready 
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	I have a deep question for Connor
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 1:46 PM	No	You choose to believe in the existence of a god, but not in the code of morality which he has very clearly outlined. I choose not to believe literally in the existence of a god as the Christian faith tells it, but I choose to live by his code of morality. My question then would be which of us is more religious under your definition? Someone who follows his teachings, or someone who believes them? 
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 1:53 PM	No	Also, how's penn? 
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 1:59 PM	Yes	Depends, do you subscribe to that code because it is his, because it is how you think people should live, or both? And in philly but not quite there yet
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 2:03 PM	No	I subscribe to it because I think that without morality one loses an integral part of what it means to be a human being
+13363914954	Aug 21, 2014, 2:54 PM	No	What does it mean to be a human being?
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 3:09 PM	No	To me?
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 3:09 PM	No	Making a lasting contribution towards the betterment of mankind in whatever field you have the most talent, and living one's life in a fashion which may be found to be morally blameless even under the harshest scrutiny 
+13363914954	Aug 21, 2014, 3:56 PM	No	'Morally blameless?' That's so subjective tho
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 3:56 PM	No	I agree that it's subjective 
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 3:56 PM	No	Which is why everyone's interpretation of how to love one's life is different 
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 3:56 PM	No	Live*
+13363914954	Aug 21, 2014, 3:58 PM	No	So there's no universal harmony?
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 4:01 PM	No	There is no universally held set of beliefs as to how to live one'z life 
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 4:01 PM	No	That doesn't mean there can't be harmony 
+13363914954	Aug 21, 2014, 4:03 PM	No	I feel like there should be one universal end-goal/philosophy that everyone aspires to, even if they do it in different ways. I'd like to think there's that unifying influence somewhere
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 4:03 PM	No	Yeah but historically attempts to unite everyone to one universal end have been pretty horrific 
+17758154378	Aug 21, 2014, 4:03 PM	No	See: holocaust 
+13363914954	Aug 21, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	That's not at all what I mean
+17344782101	Aug 22, 2014, 7:50 PM	Yes	
+17758154378	Aug 22, 2014, 7:51 PM	No

+17758154378	Sep 16, 2014, 1:21 PM	No	The use of rhetorically powerful phrases such as surely not also serves to lead the reader to think in the same line as Perricone, whose conclusion unfortunately degenerates condescension and soap-box style haranguing of the reader on the subject of human lackadaisicalness rather than a meaningful summarization of her argument. As previously mentioned, the essay is somewhat difficult to follow based solely on the unconventional style in which it is laid out  occasionally, a lack of convention in the format of an essay can lead to a more effective presentation of the material, but unfortunately for Ms. Perricone such was not true in her case. \LF
+17758154378	Sep 16, 2014, 1:21 PM	No	Just destroyed an essay written by a Princeton student

+17344782101	Oct 3, 2014, 7:04 PM	Yes	That's not terribly surprising, I feel like Ivy League golf would be super pretentious
+13363914954	Oct 3, 2014, 7:04 PM	No	This is a scene out of a movie. Holy fuck.
+17758154378	Oct 7, 2014, 12:54 AM	No	So when is our disgruntled Ivy League reunion?

+17758154378	Oct 8, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	I am considering whether or not I need one. The man who owns the liquor store right next to Columbia is Portuguese and so I can get anything I want without an ID. But I would get one to go to bars

+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	I don't have a fake
+17344782101	Oct 8, 2014, 10:43 PM	Yes	Do you want one Eric? And haha why a car Daniel? I'd rather make it something with absolutely no utility

+13363914954	Oct 9, 2014, 10:55 AM	No	I feel like I wouldn't use it that much...

+13367451259	May 15, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	I wasn't looking at vanguard, I was looking at clearbridge (SAGCX), first eagle (SGENX) which are growth funds. They've consistently out paced the market and they only purchase companies that are under valued by 20%

+13364160902	May 20, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	Freestyle isn't my forte. I guess you'll have to find someone else to give you that #1 track that puts y'all on the national map. 
+13367757093	May 20, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	International**
+12679073515	May 20, 2014, 4:15 PM	No	Plot twist. Manna quits teaching to tour the world with btl

+13367757093	May 20, 2014, 4:16 PM	No	It's not about the money, it's about self actualization, Maslow ya know 
+13364095456	May 20, 2014, 4:17 PM	No	We could hook you up with the good life. Think about it, we'll be waiting
+13364160902	May 20, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	Self-transcendence... Helping people to realize their potential through the genius of my lyrics. People helping people stuff.
+13364095456	May 20, 2014, 4:23 PM	No	Speaking of which, can it trade you a BTL cd for a Stevie J cd? You know now that I've basically graduated and were basically equals right?

+13364160902	May 20, 2014, 4:25 PM	No	I'll give you the same number of songs you give me.
+13364095456	May 20, 2014, 4:28 PM	No	Deal, l'll give you one of the old ones so you can blow off the dust from the ol' Walkman and stop listening to us on Spotify and then send you the new one when it's ready.

+13364160902	May 20, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	Lord, they're from between 2001 and 2004.
+13364160902	May 20, 2014, 4:52 PM	No	If bowling isn't going down tonight, I'm going to school to shoot and lift. It's not as strenuous as bowling, but it's exercise.

+13364095456	Jun 10, 2014, 1:58 PM	No	Swap albums AND collaborate? We could form out own band and call it Mac and Steve (a play on Mac and Cheese cause all of our songs will be so cheesy but get so many ladies)

+12679073515	Jun 21, 2014, 9:36 PM	No	http://i.imgur.com/XAGn2P9.jpg
+17758154378	Apr 25, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	Still on for paper scissors practice?

+17758154378	Apr 26, 2014, 11:00 AM	No	Maybe a tiny bit later if that's okay? My family usually goes out to lunch on Saturdays 
+13366959263	Apr 26, 2014, 11:01 AM	No	Yeah! I have to be home by about 3:15 
+13366959263	Apr 26, 2014, 11:02 AM	No	So just as soon as you can 
+17758154378	Apr 26, 2014, 11:03 AM	No	Want to cover stubborn love?

+17758154378	Apr 26, 2014, 11:06 AM	No	I think we can get a good recording of it; if Connor emails it to me after then I can master it and we can have a really good song to put online or whatever 
+13366959263	Apr 26, 2014, 11:12 AM	No	So I do or don't need to bring a kit?
+17758154378	Apr 26, 2014, 11:19 AM	No	Is the kit that's usually there not there anymore?
+17344782101	Apr 26, 2014, 11:38 AM	Yes	It is, I think Josiah was wondering if we were going to my house or yours?
+17758154378	Apr 26, 2014, 11:40 AM	No	Oh, fair question; which do you prefer? You have enough microphones to record each of us individually, I've just got one so it would be a recording of all of us playing at once 
+13366959263	Apr 26, 2014, 11:44 AM	No	Oh, Connor has the equipment and stuff so let's go there
+17758154378	Apr 26, 2014, 11:45 AM	No	Assuming that's alright with Connor?
+13366959263	Apr 26, 2014, 11:45 AM	No	O'  course
+17344782101	Apr 26, 2014, 11:51 AM	Yes	That's fine with me, I'm not sure how to best use the recording equipment I have so Daniel you may need to help me figure that out when you get here
+17344782101	Apr 26, 2014, 11:53 AM	Yes	Also if we decide we want to work on other things my piano is not nearly as flexible as yours
+17758154378	Apr 26, 2014, 11:51 AM	No	Sounds like a plan! Around  1:15?
+13366959263	Apr 26, 2014, 11:53 AM	No	Yeah Daniel definitely bring your keyboard just in case
+13366959263	Apr 26, 2014, 11:53 AM	No	Sounds great!
+17758154378	Apr 26, 2014, 12:00 PM	No	I can't; my parents have got the SUV today
+13366959263	Apr 26, 2014, 12:04 PM	No	Oh that's fine
+17344782101	Apr 26, 2014, 12:36 PM	Yes	I think I may have a work around
+17344782101	Apr 26, 2014, 12:37 PM	Yes	For the piano
+13366959263	Apr 26, 2014, 12:37 PM	No	Do it!

+13364148152	Apr 27, 2014, 11:32 AM	No	Legs
+13367757093	Apr 27, 2014, 12:25 PM	No	When?
+17046570257	Apr 27, 2014, 12:25 PM	No	I'm leaving my house now 
+13367757093	Apr 27, 2014, 12:26 PM	No	Ok

+13363914954	May 8, 2014, 12:19 PM	No	No
+13368314649	May 12, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	Everyone: please check your email. We need to meet either in person or over Skype/Google Hangout
+13363415124	May 12, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	My next exam isn't until Thursday so I'm probably free any time
+13368314649	May 12, 2014, 4:48 PM	No	Okay. Eric is going to be at states, so I doubt he will be available unless we get lucky. Anyone else?

+13368314649	May 12, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	Okay. Fine by me. I guess jay cavenaugh can just confirm or deny if this works for him when he sees it
	May 12, 2014, 4:57 PM	Yes	He just did
+13363415124	May 12, 2014, 5:04 PM	No	Ok so 2:30 at the Panera on Lewisville Clemmons Rd?
+13368314649	May 12, 2014, 5:05 PM	No	Let's do a little later than 230 to give me some time to get there from fcds
+13363415124	May 12, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	Oh yeah, maybe we should plan for more like 3:00 since it seems like a lot of exams have been finishing slightly behind schedule
+13368314649	May 12, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	Alright
+13363914954	May 12, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	I'll be available Wednesday
+13368314649	May 12, 2014, 7:41 PM	No	Solid
+13363415124	May 13, 2014, 2:58 PM	No	Anyone else at Panera yet?
+13363914954	May 13, 2014, 3:53 PM	No	We lost states by 4
+13368165198	May 13, 2014, 4:04 PM	No	Damn
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 4:08 PM	No	..
+13363914954	May 13, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	590 to 586
+13363914954	May 13, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	..
+13368165198	May 13, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	Sorry babe, drown your sorrows in
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 4:44 PM	No	How did you finish?
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 4:45 PM	No	Personally that is
+13363914954	May 13, 2014, 4:46 PM	No	Not great, not terrible
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 5:13 PM	No	Hey eric, does 12 o'clock wednesday work for you for traveling to Inmar?
+13363914954	May 13, 2014, 5:18 PM	No	By Wednesday you mean tomorrow?
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 5:19 PM	No	Yes
+13363914954	May 13, 2014, 5:23 PM	No	I think so, I ask parentals
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 8:43 PM	No	145 at inmar guys. If you get there early don't go in until 145. The fact that he said something as specific as 145 means that there probably isn't any room to be late though
+13368165198	May 13, 2014, 10:23 PM	No	You make non stressful things stressful
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 10:32 PM	No	Hahaha
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 10:32 PM	No	Good
+13368165198	May 13, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	I'm messing around with the code and it's making more sense but I'm going to need a lot of practice 
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 10:38 PM	No	"Don't we all. It's interesting. The thing Google looks for most in its hires is not their grades or accolades but their demonstrated ability to learn, because you really always have to mess with some framework or api that you've never seen. So don't fret too much about not ""knowing what you are doing"". The ability to shoot accurately from the hip makes you valuable"
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 10:38 PM	No	I've drank a little btw, so don't blame me if I sound a little wishy washy
+13363914954	May 13, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	If you write any code tonight while inebriated please comment it thoroughly. Should have good entertainment value later.
+13368165198	May 13, 2014, 10:40 PM	No	Nah it's all good and please do
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 10:43 PM	No	I've tried to do that before and sadly it's not entertaining, it's just sad. It feels like you're Ernest Hemingway after he got electro shock therapy. Look it up If you aren't familiar
+13368165198	May 13, 2014, 11:15 PM	No	
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 11:17 PM	No	Is that a LINK I see in the bottom right? Oh lawd
+13368314649	May 13, 2014, 11:18 PM	No	Looks like you can already create reddit
+13368165198	May 13, 2014, 11:19 PM	No	Haha it doesn't actually go to anything obviously
+13363914954	May 14, 2014, 10:24 AM	No	How long about will we be at inmar?
+13368314649	May 14, 2014, 10:25 AM	No	Not entirely sure. Probably less than an hour
+13368165198	May 14, 2014, 12:55 PM	No	Do I need to bring my computer?
	May 14, 2014, 12:56 PM	Yes	Yeah, just in case we end up staying there to work
+13368165198	May 14, 2014, 1:10 PM	No	Alright cool
+13368314649	May 15, 2014, 10:34 AM	No	Hey guys I am supposed to make that report today. Send me an email about what you have done, are doing, and will be doing.
	May 15, 2014, 10:35 AM	Yes	Jay d and I didn't do anything after we left
+13368314649	May 15, 2014, 10:35 AM	No	K.
+13363914954	May 15, 2014, 10:36 AM	No	Did you email Andreas?
+13368314649	May 15, 2014, 10:37 AM	No	Yesterday. I copied in your message if that's your concern
+13368314649	May 15, 2014, 10:37 AM	No	He said he would work on it
+13363914954	May 15, 2014, 10:37 AM	No	Just so he knows
+13363914954	May 15, 2014, 10:37 AM	No	I know it probably won't be fixed for a few days
+13363914954	May 15, 2014, 10:38 AM	No	That pretty much contained what I'm working on/hope to get done for next time
+13368314649	May 15, 2014, 10:39 AM	No	That JSON parsing was easy as hell. I didn't realize that you could just put it in a constructor
+13363914954	May 15, 2014, 10:40 AM	No	Yeah converting JSON to native objects is trivial, but making it extensible and robust so that they can expand the back end freely requires some standards to be established
+13363415124	May 15, 2014, 10:42 AM	No	I haven't done anything yet, and I just plan on exploring the highcharts website. I'm not sure what else I should be doing, unless Connor has ideas
+13368314649	May 15, 2014, 10:42 AM	No	I had been using a parser before, but that is apparently unnecessary
+13368314649	May 15, 2014, 10:42 AM	No	And ojay
+13363914954	May 15, 2014, 10:44 AM	No	It's the whole array of dictionaries and dictionary of arrays that gets me
+13368165198	May 15, 2014, 11:05 AM	No	I haven't done anything yet, and I just plan on exploring the highcharts website. I'm not sure what else I should be doing, unless Connor has ideas and I'm learning how to code better
	May 18, 2014, 9:50 AM	Yes	Inmar tomorrow?
	May 18, 2014, 9:50 AM	Yes	Full day?
+13368165198	May 18, 2014, 10:25 AM	No	Yeah man
+13363415124	May 18, 2014, 10:26 AM	No	Sure
+13368314649	May 18, 2014, 10:28 AM	No	Alright do you want me to email joe about it?
+13368314649	May 18, 2014, 10:28 AM	No	Wait for more responses?
+13363914954	May 18, 2014, 10:30 AM	No	I think I can come
+13368314649	May 18, 2014, 10:31 AM	No	Alright I will ask joe.
+13363914954	May 18, 2014, 10:40 AM	No	Brian, any word from our good friend Andy?
+13368314649	May 18, 2014, 10:52 AM	No	I don't remember who Andy is so no
+13368314649	May 18, 2014, 10:52 AM	No	Oh andreas. Still no
+13363914954	May 18, 2014, 10:53 AM	No	Alright. Any progress on high chart?
	May 18, 2014, 10:56 AM	Yes	Yes, I figured out how to make it work with JSON data
	May 18, 2014, 10:57 AM	Yes	Still working on how to make it work in general though
+13368314649	May 18, 2014, 10:58 AM	No	That seems contradictory ha
	May 18, 2014, 11:29 AM	Yes	Haha yeah
+13368314649	May 18, 2014, 1:47 PM	No	830 guys
	May 18, 2014, 1:58 PM	Yes	Sweet
+13368314649	May 18, 2014, 1:59 PM	No	...tonight! We work for the following 18 hrs
	May 18, 2014, 2:00 PM	Yes	Even better, then we'd be finished
+13363415124	May 18, 2014, 2:00 PM	No	Haha?
+13363415124	May 18, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	True
+13368314649	May 18, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	I was serious about it being 830 AM though
	May 19, 2014, 8:33 AM	Yes	Running a little late
+13363415124	May 19, 2014, 5:16 PM	No	...so now I figured out the error in my algorithm *facepalm*
+13363415124	May 19, 2014, 5:17 PM	No	At least Brian can make use of it I suppose, sorry you had to make a work-around Eric
+13368314649	May 19, 2014, 5:36 PM	No	Everybody has at least one email from me
+13368314649	May 20, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	Hey guys. How are you feeling about an afternoon workday tomorrow? I volunteer my house as place we could meet btw, even though it probably isn't the most central of locations for us.
+13363914954	May 20, 2014, 10:27 PM	No	I volunteer as tribute
	May 20, 2014, 11:38 PM	Yes	I can't tomorrow, I has to go to Charlotte unfortunately
+13368165198	May 21, 2014, 1:07 AM	No	I might be going to Boone
+13363415124	May 21, 2014, 10:10 AM	No	I'm free after 2:00, but I think most of what I have to do involves the stuff Connor is working on
+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 11:36 AM	No	Are we available next Wednesday to submit our project?
+13363415124	May 21, 2014, 11:54 AM	No	There might be graduation and baccalaureate practice that day, but besides that I will be available
	May 21, 2014, 12:39 PM	Yes	There's definitely a practice, jay does getting together this weekend to finish work for you?
+13363415124	May 21, 2014, 1:15 PM	No	Sure
	May 21, 2014, 1:16 PM	Yes	Sweet
+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 1:21 PM	No	Will be be able to work around those time commitments? Joe wants to know whether we can present the project wednesday or Thursday of next week
+13363914954	May 21, 2014, 1:23 PM	No	Thursday is bacca
	May 21, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	I think if we go in the morning that stuff shouldn't be an issue
+13363415124	May 21, 2014, 1:24 PM	No	Yeah
+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 1:24 PM	No	Morning of which?
+13363415124	May 21, 2014, 1:26 PM	No	On Wednesday we have to be somewhere at 11:00am,  so I'd say Thursday since it is more open, even though baccalaureate is in the evening
+13363415124	May 21, 2014, 1:26 PM	No	Unless we think we can be done by 10:30 in which case it doesn't matter
+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 1:27 PM	No	Okay let's do thurs
+13363914954	May 21, 2014, 2:07 PM	No	Thurs yay
+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 2:13 PM	No	Thursgay

+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 7:48 PM	No	I think joe might fire us if he found out, but I agree.
+13363415124	May 21, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	I'm good either way
+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	The first part was a joke, btw
+13368165198	May 21, 2014, 7:50 PM	No	HA 
+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 7:51 PM	No	I need a middle finger emoticon
+13368165198	May 21, 2014, 7:52 PM	No	And some better jokes 
	May 21, 2014, 7:52 PM	Yes	
+13368165198	May 21, 2014, 7:53 PM	No	We're going to Rachel's house at 8
	May 21, 2014, 7:54 PM	Yes	Wrong group?
+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 7:55 PM	No	Ready to bang?
+13368165198	May 21, 2014, 7:56 PM	No	Oops but that was your answer
+13368314649	May 21, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	I guess I don't have enough sense of humor to get what you are talking about
+13368165198	May 21, 2014, 8:22 PM	No	What?
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 10:41 AM	No	Do you all want to meet today?
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 11:05 AM	No	We should for a little bit if we can
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:07 AM	No	I again volunteer my house. I am the only one home so we would have no distractions but those we bring upon ourselves
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:07 AM	No	Also, andreas wants the highcharts data formats
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 11:08 AM	No	Alright. On my end at least he doesn't really need to change anything. The post processing I'm doing is minimal to fit it in.
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:10 AM	No	Is it different for the different chart types?
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:10 AM	No	Yes but I'm not sure what other chart types we are going to use
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:11 AM	No	Like it doesn't make sense to use line charts because one axis is just categories
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 11:11 AM	No	Yes we will need alternate test data
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:13 AM	No	It seemed like the data objects had two quantitative variables, but whatever. What should the alternate data look like?
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:13 AM	No	Yeah if he gave us some thing that had pairs of data  (like (x,y) format) then it would make sense to use more chart types
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:14 AM	No	One if the quantities was almost always 1
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:17 AM	No	Yeah it wouldnt make much sense to want to graph total value versus total offers anyway, at least it gives us something to play around with. In the long run how should the bivariate data look?
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:18 AM	No	Like (0,value),(1,value)...
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:19 AM	No	So we have 1 specific value per point on the x-axis
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:20 AM	No	I am actually just looking for the JSON format to send to andreas. How does high hart's want it to look?
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:20 AM	No	Can you give me an email with a quick sample, perhaps just copied and pasted from somewhere?
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 11:20 AM	No	I mean we have to parse the JSON on our end either way
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:22 AM	No	He is trying to make that work minimal, and I'm not about to stop him ha. Ideally we would be just concatenating air-rays
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 11:24 AM	No	Are we going to meet toda?
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:24 AM	No	I'm free
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:24 AM	No	Yes....?
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:24 AM	No	I think we should
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 11:30 AM	No	When?
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:33 AM	No	Now?
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:35 AM	No	My place? Barnes and Noble?
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 11:35 AM	No	Sure, can I meet at your house after lunch? Like around 12:45?
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 11:35 AM	No	Either place
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 11:36 AM	No	I've got lunch plans but I'm free for a few hours after
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:36 AM	No	Sounds good. Jay you can come on over whenever
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:37 AM	No	I think 12:45 works for me as well
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:37 AM	No	Address: 536 Cherbourg ave, winston salem 27103
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:37 AM	No	Thanks
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:45 AM	No	Brian I emailed you an idea for JSON formatting
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:46 AM	No	"Eric I think I fixed the bar charts bug where it returned ""undefined"""
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:46 AM	No	K. Thanks
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 11:52 AM	No	I'd also like to fill out the internship log today, if you guys haven't done that already
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 12:10 PM	No	Lovely and yes
+13368165198	May 22, 2014, 1:19 PM	No	Good morning everyone
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 1:20 PM	No	Cum to my house if you can. Jay and eric are here
+13368165198	May 22, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	I can't right now but I'll work from home
+13363415124	May 22, 2014, 3:16 PM	No	
	May 22, 2014, 4:43 PM	Yes	Haha jay the consensus was to count those hours
+13363914954	May 22, 2014, 10:47 PM	No	You all want to meat tomorrow?
	May 22, 2014, 10:48 PM	Yes	Sounds a little gay
	May 22, 2014, 10:48 PM	Yes	But I'm in
+13368165198	May 22, 2014, 10:49 PM	No	I've got y'all covered
+13368314649	May 22, 2014, 11:05 PM	No	Sounds tight
+13368314649	May 23, 2014, 9:35 AM	No	10:30-11:30 on Thursday work for us to present?
+13363415124	May 23, 2014, 9:43 AM	No	Good for me
+13363415124	May 23, 2014, 9:44 AM	No	Speaking of times, when is good for everybody to meet today?
	May 23, 2014, 10:54 AM	Yes	Noon, my house?
+13368314649	May 23, 2014, 10:55 AM	No	Alright, so Thursday is good?
+13368314649	May 23, 2014, 10:55 AM	No	Above^
	May 23, 2014, 10:56 AM	Yes	I can't currently think of any reasons why it wouldnt be
+13368314649	May 23, 2014, 11:02 AM	No	We are booked for 1015 on Thursday to display our product. Let's get down to business
+13368314649	May 23, 2014, 11:05 AM	No	Yo brad where are you?
+13363914954	May 23, 2014, 11:09 AM	No	Lol awk

+13368314649	May 23, 2014, 11:10 AM	No	Oops
+13363914954	May 23, 2014, 11:11 AM	No	Meeting at Connor's house at noon
+13363415124	May 23, 2014, 11:11 AM	No	Alright
+13363914954	May 23, 2014, 11:16 AM	No	Where do you live bungbeetle
+13363914954	May 23, 2014, 11:49 AM	No	So we ARE meeting at noon at connor's today, right?
+13363415124	May 23, 2014, 11:52 AM	No	Yes?
	May 23, 2014, 11:52 AM	Yes	Yeah
	May 23, 2014, 11:52 AM	Yes	3910 white hawk lane
+13368165198	May 23, 2014, 12:10 PM	No	I'll be there at 1
+13363914954	May 23, 2014, 12:22 PM	No	Yo I'm here

+13363415124	May 23, 2014, 12:24 PM	No	Doors open
+13363914954	May 23, 2014, 12:27 PM	No	Where the fuck are you
+13363415124	May 24, 2014, 12:34 PM	No	.../brands/OffersByBrand/ is not updated to the new API format, so someone needs to tell Andreas
+13363415124	May 24, 2014, 12:35 PM	No	"It still uses ""count"""
+13368314649	May 24, 2014, 12:36 PM	No	Okay
+13363914954	May 24, 2014, 12:47 PM	No	Okay good, that's why it was effing up
+13363914954	May 24, 2014, 12:53 PM	No	Does anyone have a propane tank that isn't full?
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 3:02 PM	No	
+13368314649	May 25, 2014, 3:15 PM	No	Jay can you add a function that will try to navigate to a url (doesn't matter where) when the chart finishes loading?
+13368314649	May 25, 2014, 3:16 PM	No	I need a callback to know when to stop my progressbar
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 3:17 PM	No	Yeah Eric asked for that as well
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 3:18 PM	No	You might have the version with that in your email
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 3:18 PM	No	But I can send the most recent version right now just to be sure
+13368314649	May 25, 2014, 3:18 PM	No	K
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 3:25 PM	No	"It loads a URL that's just ""SUCCESS"""
+13363415124	May 25, 2014, 3:25 PM	No	Sent
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 3:25 PM	No	When happy times have commenced
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 3:26 PM	No	Brian, Andy get back to you about the email you sent yesterday?
+13368314649	May 25, 2014, 3:26 PM	No	No
	May 25, 2014, 3:29 PM	Yes	Eric what chart types does the app support?
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 3:55 PM	No	Does the app support? What do you mean
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 3:55 PM	No	It supports whatever we make it support
	May 25, 2014, 3:56 PM	Yes	Yeah, what is that right now?
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 4:20 PM	No	It does scatter bar and pie
	May 25, 2014, 4:21 PM	Yes	Thanks
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 4:22 PM	No	Yes milady
	May 25, 2014, 6:16 PM	Yes	Did y'all know that there are now categories attached to each of the items?
+13368314649	May 25, 2014, 6:16 PM	No	Yes
	May 25, 2014, 6:17 PM	Yes	Are we displaying by category or individual item then?
+13368314649	May 25, 2014, 6:18 PM	No	"Define ""by"""
	May 25, 2014, 6:18 PM	Yes	Are pieces of the pie, the bars, etc categories or individual items?
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 6:19 PM	No	Individual items
+13363914954	May 25, 2014, 6:20 PM	No	Categories are for filtering/searching
+13368314649	May 25, 2014, 6:20 PM	No	Still items you can filter by category though
	May 25, 2014, 6:20 PM	Yes	Alright
+13363914954	May 27, 2014, 5:34 PM	No	What's the deal for the presentation Thursday?
+13363415124	May 27, 2014, 5:35 PM	No	I remember hearing 10:30-11:30, did we ever confirm that?
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 5:38 PM	No	We show up at 1015
+13363914954	May 27, 2014, 5:49 PM	No	And how are we going to do it?
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 5:50 PM	No	If it works on an emulator we can project it.
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 5:51 PM	No	Also show what would have to be done to modify the current setup
+13363914954	May 27, 2014, 5:51 PM	No	Each individual app?
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 5:52 PM	No	I mean they are pretty similar, so we would probably present one and then show the diffeeences.
	May 27, 2014, 5:53 PM	Yes	Should we meet and figure out what those are? I honestly have no idea what either of yours looks like
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 5:54 PM	No	Yours operates independently I think. I'm not sure your feature s are very similar
	May 27, 2014, 5:55 PM	Yes	That's my point, I don't know what features y'all's have and vice versa
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 5:56 PM	No	We can compare if you'd like, but I think we are going to end up doing two reports: the mobile app and the web app, even though I did not originally state that
	May 27, 2014, 6:00 PM	Yes	That's fine, what features of the mobile app are you thinking are going to be dissimilar to the web app?
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 6:01 PM	No	Filtering ability. Switching between graph types.
	May 27, 2014, 6:01 PM	Yes	Web app has both of those actually
	May 27, 2014, 6:09 PM	Yes	Anything else?
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 6:12 PM	No	Not sure. And the fact that we both have them is not necessarily of interest if the features operate differently
	May 27, 2014, 6:13 PM	Yes	I'm not entirely sure I understand what you mean by operate differently, maybe comparing them before hand would be beneficial?
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 6:14 PM	No	Sure.
+13363415124	May 27, 2014, 6:15 PM	No	Connor your entire user interface is totally different so you probably want to show at least that
+13368314649	May 27, 2014, 6:15 PM	No	^
	May 27, 2014, 6:17 PM	Yes	Of course, but it would be nice to all be on the same page in terms of functionality
+13363415124	May 27, 2014, 6:19 PM	No	Yeah I think it would be great if we could meet some time tomorrow
	May 27, 2014, 6:22 PM	Yes	Between rehearsals?
+13363415124	May 28, 2014, 10:32 AM	No	That works nicely for me
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:35 AM	No	Wher we meat
	May 28, 2014, 10:36 AM	Yes	We can just figure that out at school
+13368165198	May 28, 2014, 12:37 PM	No	444 Roslyn Road
+13363415124	May 28, 2014, 5:54 PM	No	So I was wrong about having a bunch of free time right now, but I'll send you guys the report some time tonight
+13368314649	May 28, 2014, 5:55 PM	No	Do you want me to handle it?
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 6:10 PM	No	Lols don't worry jay someone will get it
+13368314649	May 28, 2014, 7:15 PM	No	New Andreas update: he did whatever the fuck you asked him
	May 28, 2014, 7:21 PM	Yes	What did we ask him?
+13368314649	May 28, 2014, 7:23 PM	No	I actually don't know! Eric just did the deed
	May 28, 2014, 7:24 PM	Yes	Eric what did we ask him to do?
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:15 PM	No	Fix the api
	May 28, 2014, 10:16 PM	Yes	In what way?
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	Every way
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:16 PM	No	He made it sentient so we don't need our apps anymore
	May 28, 2014, 10:17 PM	Yes	Haha, is my app going to be broken or no?
+13368314649	May 28, 2014, 10:17 PM	No	Haha
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:17 PM	No	You tell me
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:17 PM	No	Taptools.net/taptools/inmar
	May 28, 2014, 10:20 PM	Yes	It appears not to be
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	Well that's good
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	All I did was ask he fix the OffersBtBrand
	May 28, 2014, 10:21 PM	Yes	He needs to add categories to some of the data too
+13363415124	May 28, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	Not sure if you guys think this is late but I sent out the report
	May 28, 2014, 10:34 PM	Yes	It's too late, I refuse to look at it
+13363415124	May 28, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	:D  I mean like hopefully people are still awake
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	Well I thin the data intentionally isn't categorized for some parts
	May 28, 2014, 10:45 PM	Yes	Whether it's intentional or not, it makes sense for all of the data that we have worked with to be categorized
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:45 PM	No	Well I think the 'Offers by Brand' data is meant to be viewed by brand, not category. Hence the name
	May 28, 2014, 10:47 PM	Yes	It still makes sense to categorize, seeing all of those data points together is kind of valueless, it's too much information to process or do anything with
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	Well you can filter it and only enable the ones you're interested in
	May 28, 2014, 10:52 PM	Yes	That would make the pie chart kind of irrelevant to that data then, what fraction a piece is of a random grouping I've selected is not useful
+13368314649	May 28, 2014, 10:55 PM	No	This product obviously isn't going to make sense until they use real data. We can't know what they will need for that until they decide to put it out there. We were limited originally by their lack of specificity in the exact kinds of things they will display. going back to what they originally said, they never asked for a finished product; they asked for a template they could use to extend their platform later
+13363914954	May 28, 2014, 10:55 PM	No	Dude, they don't want it by category. So that's how it is haha. I asked him to change it and he didn't
	May 28, 2014, 10:56 PM	Yes	Haha okay
+13363415124	May 28, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	So um about the report... did I make what we need? I sent it out, if you missed that
+13368165198	May 29, 2014, 9:20 AM	No	Coat and tie?
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 9:20 AM	No	Button down and pants
+13363914954	May 29, 2014, 9:27 AM	No	No pants
+13363914954	May 29, 2014, 9:27 AM	No	Just the button down
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 10:09 AM	No	No parking out front
+13368165198	May 29, 2014, 10:10 AM	No	There's nowhere to park
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 10:11 AM	No	Go around back.
+13368165198	May 29, 2014, 10:11 AM	No	To the lower part?
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 10:12 AM	No	Yes
+13363415124	May 29, 2014, 10:25 AM	No	I'm in the lobby where are you guys?
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 1:51 PM	No	Everybody put your code on github. Andreas' account is abenamou
+13363415124	May 29, 2014, 10:06 PM	No	He probably just wants the apps right? Or do you think he wants my stuff?
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 10:08 PM	No	No you are good jay. You might want to document your thing though. Write a README file or comment the hell out of a sampling of your files
+13363415124	May 29, 2014, 10:10 PM	No	Ok thanks
+13368165198	Jul 6, 2014, 9:05 PM	No	Hey guys, can y'all meet at inmar on Tuesday? Connor's dad wants to show us something helpful
+17344782101	Jul 6, 2014, 9:06 PM	Yes	Not sure about the Tuesday thing though
+13363415124	Jul 6, 2014, 9:06 PM	No	Yes I can
+17344782101	Jul 6, 2014, 9:06 PM	Yes	What he meant was some time this week 
+13363415124	Jul 6, 2014, 9:07 PM	No	Alright
+13363415124	Jul 6, 2014, 9:07 PM	No	What is this about?
+17344782101	Jul 6, 2014, 9:07 PM	Yes	Advice on how to give better presentations, because the one we did kind of sucked
+13368314649	Jul 6, 2014, 9:09 PM	No	Not sure I'm interested but I'll go out of respect for the king.
+13363914954	Jul 6, 2014, 9:14 PM	No	I can go Monday or Tuesday.
+13368314649	Jul 6, 2014, 10:28 PM	No	So what's the deal? Tomorrow or Tues?  I need to know which day to not be out of town
+13368314649	Jul 6, 2014, 10:42 PM	No	The light on my spotlight is dead, so I can't turn on the connor-signal
+17344782101	Jul 6, 2014, 10:45 PM	Yes	I don't know, my dad just mentioned it in passing, if you can't make it's not a big deal, I'm not sure when I'll have specifics 
+13368314649	Jul 6, 2014, 10:48 PM	No	Okay. Probably not tomorrow anyway then. Cool
+13363914954	Jul 6, 2014, 11:04 PM	No	Alright. I won't be in town Wednesday-Sunday
+17344782101	Jul 6, 2014, 11:25 PM	Yes	Okay
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 9:11 PM	Yes	Hey yasmine it's connor, what did I do that bothered you? I'm not asking to be obnoxious, I would just like, if possible, to fix it
+13364083071	May 9, 2014, 9:14 PM	No	The numbers just didn't work out! It's nothing personal, don't worry about it.
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 9:25 PM	Yes	You really think I buy that? 
+13364083071	May 9, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	Okay truth is I don't like you at all and you're not helping your case
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 9:38 PM	Yes	Much better, look this doesn't feel like it's been a problem in the past? What did I do? Can I do anything to make it better? You say I'm not helping my case but you already dislike me enough for the uninvite so I'm not really sure my case can be hurt much
+13364083071	May 9, 2014, 10:39 PM	No	You threw your condom on the floor... That's disrespectful and rude. You have no interest in friendship all you do is take advantage of girls and that's a disgusting trait. I'm sorry, but based on what I have seen of you, I think very little of you. Change that if you can, if not, that's life  
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 11:08 PM	Yes	I'm sorry about the condom, your right that is rude. But Yasmine, I care quiet a bit about friendship. I wanted it with Corinne, she didn't, what can I do but respect that?Why would I be talking to you about this if I didn't care about my relationships? And for the record, I hate the fact the girls hook up with guys for reasons other then that they want too, because I can't always pick up on it, I mess up, and I feel like a shit person when I find out later that a girl regrets having been with me
+13364083071	May 9, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	Connor you thrive on that vulnerability. I'm too drunk to talk about this, and you don't have to justify anything. Actions speak louder than words. When I see you as a trustworthy, honest person I will want to have you around, otherwise no. 
+17344782101	May 9, 2014, 11:42 PM	Yes	Yasmine that's a very easy thing to say and feel morally superior about, but you have no intention of giving me a chance to change your perception of me, you are a shallow piece of shit, and you are petty enough to ostracize someone for selfish reasons, and then to have his friend lie to him about it, I am an honest person, look in a goddamn mirror before you go criticizing other people
+13364083071	May 10, 2014, 12:44 AM	No	Sounds great!
+13366713320	May 10, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	
+17344781253	May 10, 2014, 12:49 PM	No	You've never said that
+13366713320	May 10, 2014, 12:50 PM	No	Hmmm
+17344782101	Oct 24, 2014, 10:21 PM	Yes	Love you all, and really appreciate that you are here visiting, don't think I'm going to make it back to the hotel tonight, but look forward to seeing all of you in the morning at dim sum
+13367451259	Oct 24, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	Love you too! We are very excited to be here with you this weekend! See you in the morning.
+13366089582	Oct 24, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	Hey Connor love you 
+17344782101	Oct 24, 2014, 10:24 PM	Yes	Love you peanut head
+13366089582	Oct 24, 2014, 10:24 PM	No	 Best bro ever 
+17344781254	Oct 24, 2014, 10:27 PM	No	Love you hopefully you will have more time for us tomorrow...,.,
+17344782101	May 10, 2014, 6:11 PM	Yes	Hey Logan, my names Connor and I'll be headed to CONA with you this summer. Unfortunately I won't have first hand experience as a student until this fall, but Tess mentioned that you might be interested in attending Wharton and I wanted to let you know that I am available if you have any questions.
+19103866944	May 10, 2014, 6:14 PM	No	Thanks man yeah I'm really interested in Wharton like do you have any recommendations for stuff I need to do to get in?
+17344782101	May 10, 2014, 6:32 PM	Yes	I would say that the most important thing for Wharton, and any other school really, is finding what your passionate about and working at it until you are great. In talking to some of my peers at Quaker days the following came up frequently: involvement with DECA, successful management of a personal investment portfolio, founding successful companies, and community service work involving the application of business related skills. Don't panic if none of those applied to you, it's not at all a comprehensive list, just some examples of how kids have shown their passion and aptitude for business, which is what you need to figure out how best to do for you. Of course you need exceptional test scores and gpa as well.
+19103866944	May 10, 2014, 6:41 PM	No	Yeah absolutely. I'm only a sophomore so I still have time to do some of those things. I've heard of deca but we don't have a chapter at my school so I'm thinking about bringing one. Were/are you a part of it?
+17344782101	May 10, 2014, 6:47 PM	Yes	I actually didn't hear about deca until this year, so I'm not familiar with it but have heard good things. Starting a chapter at your school is an excellent idea. There is one other thing I would highly recommend, and that's business related research at a nearby university. This is not something I did or heard of anyone doing, and that is primarily why I am suggesting it, innovative research if you could make it work, would be incredibly distinguishing, and markedly improve your chances of gaining admission.
+19103866944	May 10, 2014, 6:49 PM	No	Yeah definitely I live in Wilmington and uncw has a good business school so I could definitely do some stuff there it's just I don't really know who to contact or how to go about getting in touch with the people I need to ya know?  I don't really have any connections to the business world (which I feel like having them would also increase my chances of getting accepted)
+17344782101	May 10, 2014, 7:25 PM	Yes	The best way to find them is reading about the professors and their research on the schools site, and then polite, informed, and intelligent emails. Business world connections certainly do help, you have time though, and seeking out research opportunities or internships will definitely help you develop your network. Make a linked in.
+19103866944	May 10, 2014, 7:32 PM	No	I'll do that thanks so much
+17344782101	May 10, 2014, 7:33 PM	Yes	Yeah no problem, if anything else comes up feel free to ask
+19103866944	May 10, 2014, 7:34 PM	No	
	May 12, 2014, 7:05 PM	Yes	Poker at my house in half an hour if anyone's interested
+13368165198	May 12, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	Is this the first day you don't have an exam?

+13364086079	May 22, 2014, 1:18 PM	No	So pumped 
+13368165198	May 22, 2014, 1:21 PM	No	We can meet at my house since it's by the highway, my house at 5:15
+13364068233	May 22, 2014, 1:26 PM	No	No because your house is opposite of the way we need to go
+13366959263	May 22, 2014, 1:32 PM	No	Is it?
+13368165198	May 22, 2014, 1:32 PM	No	No it isn't?

+13366959263	May 22, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	David's is probably best
+13364068233	May 22, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	Me and David both live like 3 minutes from the highway, so not that far
+13364068233	May 22, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	Let's meet at either me or David's house
+13364068233	May 22, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	If David's cool with that

+13366959263	May 22, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	So, David's at 5:23?
+17344782101	May 22, 2014, 1:58 PM	Yes	Yeah but the cars at my house, so we go there, does everyone see how that works?

+13364068233	May 22, 2014, 2:00 PM	No	That would make sense
+17344782101	May 22, 2014, 2:00 PM	Yes	Actually we should meet wherever we're sleeping, that way everyone's car will be accessible in the morning
+13364086079	May 22, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	Oh yeah that's a good point 
+13364086079	May 22, 2014, 2:05 PM	No	Y'all could sleep at my house if you want but there's not much room

+17758154378	Jul 19, 2014, 1:55 PM	No	Gentlemen, I have one last project for us to do. I just remade the beat to MGK's Wild Boy and I think it would be hilarious to do what we did with All Tay Everything but instead of Wild Boy we make the song Mild Boy and the rap is about suburban white activities and other non-gangster stuff. This will be the greatest music video and lyrical accomplishment of our young lives and we'll all be rapping on the track this time instead of just me. I think it would be fun to do one last idiotic thing with you guys before we enter the crappy world of adulthood. What do you say? 
+13364068233	Jul 19, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	Let's do it

+13366959263	Nov 14, 2014, 4:14 PM	No	Why'd your down vote it bro?
+13368165198	Nov 14, 2014, 4:20 PM	No	Because it's obnoxious
+13364036025	Nov 14, 2014, 4:20 PM	No	Lol I thought it was pretty funny
+13364036025	Nov 14, 2014, 4:21 PM	No	Its been reposted a billion times but still funny 
+13366959263	Nov 14, 2014, 4:22 PM	No	
+13368165198	Nov 14, 2014, 4:22 PM	No	
+17758154378	Nov 14, 2014, 4:23 PM	No	I was required to attend a lecture this morning where we heard a current porn star talk about feminism 
+17758154378	Nov 14, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	I raised my hand and asked how many gallons of cum you had to swallow before you were considered a feminist 
+17758154378	Nov 14, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	I was excused from the lecture 
+13368165198	Nov 14, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	Wow that that person exists
+13366959263	Nov 14, 2014, 4:25 PM	No	I never know when to believe you
+17758154378	Nov 14, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	Now would be the time 
+13368165198	Nov 14, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	Did she answer?
+17758154378	Nov 14, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	Unfortunately not so I will never know if Ive qualified or not 
+17758154378	Nov 14, 2014, 4:28 PM	No	Im just going to keep swallowing in the hopes that I reach the quantity 
+13362873952	May 22, 2014, 9:21 AM	No	AP Bio friends, do you guys want to go to the zoo on Monday? It's memorial day but if you guys aren't busy/still want to go, I can drive us. Tickets are $12.

+13365773265	May 23, 2014, 12:34 PM	No	
+13366242404	May 23, 2014, 1:21 PM	No	I can do that 
+13368137454	May 23, 2014, 1:21 PM	No	Wait can y'all do tomorrow night?
+13366242404	May 23, 2014, 1:21 PM	No	Probably not...
+13367037963	May 23, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	I can do either.
+13365773265	May 23, 2014, 1:56 PM	No	I can't tomorrow for sure 
+13368137454	May 23, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	I think I can come
+13368137454	May 23, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	Tonight I mean
+13365773265	May 23, 2014, 5:07 PM	No	WUT R WE DOIN

+13365291279	May 23, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	Neighbors
+13366242404	May 23, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	drugz n hugz n snugz
+13365299735	May 23, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	
+13365773265	May 23, 2014, 5:56 PM	No	Cookout 830 okaaaaay
+13367037963	May 23, 2014, 5:57 PM	No	Sure.
+13367037963	May 23, 2014, 5:57 PM	No	Also, I just saw the drug reference. I do not approve.
+13365291279	May 23, 2014, 5:58 PM	No	Give hugs, not drugs mmmkayyy. 
+13367037963	May 23, 2014, 5:59 PM	No	That seems to be a reasonable proposition.
+13366242404	May 23, 2014, 5:59 PM	No	Snugz + hugz - drugz = cookout at 8:30
+13365291279	May 24, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	Just tell me when you need me
	May 29, 2014, 3:11 PM	Yes	I talked to my dad and the offer was extended to the entire team
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 3:12 PM	No	Oh wow cool.
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 3:12 PM	No	But then I guess they probably aren't paying us then.
	May 29, 2014, 3:38 PM	Yes	No they probably are, we just need to talk to the group and make it very clear that if you aren't going to pull your weight you don't take the offer
+13363914954	May 29, 2014, 3:46 PM	No	Yeah I agree. We're more likely to get a good pay offer if we approach the inmar guys saying we are interested in doing this but we want to be very serious about it, not like a 'let's teach someone to code' kind of deal
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 3:49 PM	No	Okay well in my email to greg and andreas I was very candid about everyone's contributions and ability. They were made aware that Jay C can't really contribute much, Jay Do can't do much without guidance. I worded it such that Connor would be assumed to be proficient and a bit experienced in Javascript.
	May 29, 2014, 3:53 PM	Yes	Haha okay, I would go ahead and copy Eric, me and jay d if he's interested on any future correspondence until we start working out our own details independently
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 3:54 PM	No	I gave them everyone's email, and mentioned that individual conversations might be better due to scheduling issues
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 3:57 PM	No	The Git cat - thing is next - level creepy
+13363914954	May 29, 2014, 4:01 PM	No	Sweet. I need to get that set up
+13368314649	May 29, 2014, 4:01 PM	No	It is surprisingly involved
+13363914954	May 29, 2014, 4:03 PM	No	Yeah so I've hear
+13363914954	May 29, 2014, 4:03 PM	No	D
	May 30, 2014, 2:31 PM	Yes	I am having some difficulties with GitHub, I emailed the two of you the error I kept getting, if y'all could take a look at it that be great, I think it may have something to do with the fact that the project uses a template that comes from github but I have no idea why that would break it or how to fix it, everything I've read has gone over my head
+13368314649	May 30, 2014, 3:42 PM	No	He told me to just send him a .zip file
+13368314649	Sep 18, 2014, 6:08 PM	No	Hey guys. I am at a hack night tonight, and I am debating whether to voice an idea or save it for princeton. It is an app that listens to you tap out a beat over the microphone, and then replaces the hits with actual drum sounds. You can then play it back, layer multiple beats, etc. Are we more ambitious than that for our princeton hacks idea?
+17344782101	Sep 18, 2014, 6:13 PM	Yes	I like the idea, but don't think we'll have a hard time coming up with other ones before princeton if you want to use it tonight
+13363914954	Sep 18, 2014, 7:14 PM	No	I agree with Connor, but it's your idea, so it's your call.
+13368314649	Sep 20, 2014, 5:12 PM	No	"Search ""Myo"", and let your mind explode from all the ideas this thing makes possible. They were going to have some of the first ones at HackGT, but they got mixed up in the mail."
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 8:33 AM	No	Just got an email back from the princeton guy. We are guaranteed to be accepted on eric's team. Can yall say something back so I know you got this?
+17344782101	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 AM	Yes	Got it, sweet
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 5:00 PM	No	I didn't get it.
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 5:00 PM	No	Oh you
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:10 PM	No	Fuck guys, did you hear?
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	I think I did, once
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:11 PM	No	About Alex Rickabaugh?
+17344782101	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	Yes	Yeah
+17344782101	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	Yes	Really fucking depressing
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	Nah
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	Well, he killed himself
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:13 PM	No	"I'm going to say ""rickarimjob"" one more time before something bad happened and I can't say it anymore"
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:13 PM	No	What was it?
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 PM	No	Okay. The suspense has been built. Wtf happened
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 PM	No	OD.
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:16 PM	No	Intentionally or nah?
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:16 PM	No	Hard to say?
+17344782101	Sep 22, 2014, 11:22 PM	Yes	He posted on facebook around midnight
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	"Saying, ""println ('goodbye world')""? I'm not friends with him so I can't tell"
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	And I don't think he'll be accepting my request
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	Intentionally.
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	And yes, he actually did say something to that effect.
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:34 PM	No	Yeah, I figured it out by analysis of his friends posts. Did he specify a reason?
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:35 PM	No	No, I don't believe so. I think he'd been struggling with some psychological problems, though. Not sure if it was precipitated by any one factor.
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:43 PM	No	Eh. I wish we got at least a couple of seconds worth of afterlife. Religious people have it nice,  thinking that everyone will get their questions answered. Just a couple seconds would be long enough to see that we really were okay to not believe in god, and that the religiius people will feel pretty silly when they die, and to see whether killing ourselves was a good idea (for those to whom that applies).
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:45 PM	No	"But unfortunately, we can't say ""rest in peace"". Death just isn't the same as rest."
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:49 PM	No	It's hard to say. I wonder if, in his final moments, he felt as though a burden were at last being lifted; that in some strange way, he had overcome some monumental obstacle.
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:49 PM	No	"Much more moderate afterlife:  the people who were right get to say ""yes!"" like the teacher called on them and they answered correctly. And hell is replaced with people feeling silly for about a minute and a half about being so sure about something and being incorrect."
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:49 PM	No	I doubt it. He was probably REALLY high
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:50 PM	No	No, he didn't overdose on heroin.
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:50 PM	No	It would have been some sort of medical prescription
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:51 PM	No	What was it?
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:51 PM	No	Milk?
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:51 PM	No	Could have been any number of things. Shit, you take a bottle of aspirin and you're dead.
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:52 PM	No	Vicodin, morphine, and a lot of other prescription drugs are opiates, as is heroine
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:53 PM	No	I guess. In that case he was probably bleeding into his brain or something. I think that, in any case, he felt either really under the whether or way on top of it
+13363914954	Sep 22, 2014, 11:55 PM	No	I feel like he would have lost consciousness before he actually died. I just mean, in his last moment of relative lucidity, did he feel relief or regret?
+13368314649	Sep 22, 2014, 11:58 PM	No	I am guessing he felt pretty relaxed/relieved.
+13368314649	Sep 25, 2014, 11:43 AM	No	I am going to send you guys a Google doc that we can use to plan our hack. Can you guys send me an email address?
	Sep 25, 2014, 11:44 AM	Yes	cmounts@wharton.upenn.edu
+13363914954	Sep 25, 2014, 2:43 PM	No	eam6@princeton.edu
+13368314649	Sep 25, 2014, 4:04 PM	No	K
+13363914954	Sep 25, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	Bri have you looked into the possibility of getting our hands on a Myo unit for experimentation?
	Sep 25, 2014, 8:47 PM	Yes	Looks like Myo dev kits are shipping now for 150
+13368314649	Sep 25, 2014, 8:47 PM	No	They are $150, and they were just released. Developers get preference for shipment though. I will definately at least check one out at HackNC
+13368314649	Sep 25, 2014, 8:49 PM	No	--which I just got an email from. They are reimbursing 20 cents per mile of travel to Chapel Hill, so I might actually make some money on the Greyhound to Chapel Thrill
+13368314649	Sep 25, 2014, 8:53 PM	No	Also, check out Leap Motion. Perhaps it will inspire an idea
+13368314649	Sep 25, 2014, 9:35 PM	No	Watching godzilla and then looking out on a city with a skyline is freaky as fuck
+13363914954	Sep 26, 2014, 2:02 PM	No	HackNC is UNC's hackathon?
+13368314649	Sep 26, 2014, 2:04 PM	No	Yes
	Sep 29, 2014, 2:06 AM	Yes	I kind of want to buy a myo dev kit, and start learning how to use it, good or bad idea?
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 8:24 AM	No	Depends how often you are going to use it afterwards. If you just want to mess around with it before Hack Princeton, you might just want to hit up other hackathons on your area. I'm going to mess with the Myo when I go to HackNC in the middle of october.
	Sep 29, 2014, 11:14 AM	Yes	I feel like it's not something I would regret having, the question is more about whether spending my time in that way maximizes my ability to contribute to the group, or if my time would be better spent focused on other deficiencies, basically do we like the idea of Myo enough that we shape our project around using it? Also when do we officially hear back from princeton?
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 11:22 AM	No	Oct 2. I think we need to figure out our project, or at least a short list of possible projects, before we can figure out what an optimal use of our time is
+13363914954	Sep 29, 2014, 11:37 AM	No	You guys are guaranteed to get in because you're on my team, since I'm a student. I think it's worth tinkering with the thing to see how much we can do with it. Ideally we'd be able to combine it with our current knowledge of mobile development, potentially creating some sort of mobile interface for some feature created by the Myo?
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 11:52 AM	No	Okay. I think to have everyone working on the same mobile platform, so which do we want to do: iOS or Android? Java, Android will be less problematic to use during the hackathon, because then I won't have to borrow a mac, but I have been wanting to learn Swift anyway.
+13363914954	Sep 29, 2014, 11:55 AM	No	Eh, doesn't really matter. I feel like it might be best to have everyone working on the platform they are most proficient on though...
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 11:58 AM	No	That poses the question of whether you think that having multiple platforms supported by the end of the Hackathon is  important. If not, then it doesn't matter how inefficient someone is; as long as they are not detracting from the development, our overall productivity will be greater than if each person were working on a project individually.
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 11:59 AM	No	Depending on the project, we might need more than one platform anyway. For instance, any app with a server backend is going to need to have someone write that server backend.
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 12:02 PM	No	Do you see what I'm trying to say?
	Sep 29, 2014, 12:05 PM	Yes	Yes, on a side note, If we decide were looking to develop some sort of mobile interface for some myo feature, then it would sense for me to become proficient in Luna and myo, and handle integration of that into whatever the two of you develop on mobile, since I'm substantially behind the two of you with mobile
	Sep 29, 2014, 12:05 PM	Yes	And we're all at zero with myo
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 12:11 PM	No	We are dealing with two questions here: should connor start with Myo? Which (if only one) mobile platform should we use? My answer to the first question is yes, if we go ahead and decide on our project, and it involves the Myo. I think we should decide on what we want to build based on what we want it to do, not in what it is made of.
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 12:20 PM	No	Can you think of anything that you actually want to do with the myo?
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 12:25 PM	No	Oooh! Nother idea for the Myo
+13363914954	Sep 29, 2014, 12:44 PM	No	I mean at this point I'd just like to get some perspective as to the development process for Myo. How quick can it get up and running? What is the environment like? Etc
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 12:47 PM	No	If you look at the website you will know as much as I do. It can interface with mobile phones, apparently. I know that people often use these at Hackathons, so by inference it is not out of scope for HackPrinceton. I'll go ahead and look it up.
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 1:41 PM	No	Oh my God its fairy-tale easy
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 1:45 PM	No	Also, I updated our planning doc with another idea.
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 1:48 PM	No	You just enable Bluetooth and run a method to connect to the nearest Myo. You then set a listener for gestures and it's game on
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	I'm getting annoyed at this method of communication. When we wait two hours between each message it feels about as efficient as a smoke signal.
	Sep 29, 2014, 2:01 PM	Yes	Haha maybe we should agree on a time to video conference and figure everything out then? I would be more responsive but am extremely behind and in the middle of mid terms so writing lengthy text messages is kind of inconvenient at the moment
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 2:06 PM	No	I understand. I just got through mine. The passing grade for my Calc2 test was a 30. Class average average was a 50. Let's find a time when everyone is available. I'm available anytime that after eight on any day of the week.
	Sep 29, 2014, 2:09 PM	Yes	Haha I was looking at past exams, and I'll be happy if I get any points on my math midterm at all, and sounds good, not going to be able to do more than hour this week though, and good after eight tomorrow, maybe Thursday depending on how things go
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 2:11 PM	No	Okay. Depending on what eric's availability turns out to be, I'll get back in touch sooner to then
+13363914954	Sep 29, 2014, 2:41 PM	No	Midterms? The fuck? Our midterms are in 3 weeks
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 2:42 PM	No	That would make sense. You started about three weeks after us, no?
+13363914954	Sep 29, 2014, 2:43 PM	No	Yeah I guess. Seems so early for midterms haha
+13368314649	Sep 29, 2014, 2:57 PM	No	Time has been flying for me. I feel like I'm going to be 60 in no time at this rate
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	"I found another person who pronounces ""array"" like ""air ray"""
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 7:26 PM	No	Did you learn to code by listening to a tutorial by an Indian guy?
+13363914954	Oct 2, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	Looool
	Oct 2, 2014, 7:29 PM	Yes	Haha no, I still say air Ray by the way
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 7:37 PM	No	Oh, it's a capital Ray. I guess it is just a Freudian slip.
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 7:52 PM	No	Anyway, do you guys have the ability to talk Hackathon tonight on Skype or something?
	Oct 2, 2014, 7:58 PM	Yes	I can skype now but I have to work while doing it, can't later
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 8:28 PM	No	Eric?
+13363914954	Oct 2, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	Eh fack. Right now?
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 8:42 PM	No	Not Necessarily
	Oct 2, 2014, 8:44 PM	Yes	Busy after ten
	Oct 2, 2014, 10:32 PM	Yes	Actually not busy any more if yall still want to skype
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	I'm game
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	Just finished that cs homework. I am so over modelling inheritance using animals.
	Oct 2, 2014, 10:38 PM	Yes	Haha at least you know how to do that, I had to spend four hours trying to write an insertion method for quad trees in ocaml the other day
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:38 PM	No	Brainmurphy@hotmail.com
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:41 PM	No	You should do competitive programming. Solving a problem with DP makes you feel like a badass. What is your Skype name?
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:43 PM	No	Sometimes you've just got to give eric ring. Everyone is on board; let's gooo
+13363914954	Oct 2, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	Fucking recursion though
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:46 PM	No	Is someone going to call me? Whoever doesn't Skype me first needs to also text their Skype name so we can add you.
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:46 PM	No	Greatness awaits
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:47 PM	No	Also, I am awaiting.
	Oct 2, 2014, 10:49 PM	Yes	In a sec, have to set up my skype
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:49 PM	No	And awaiting
+13363914954	Oct 2, 2014, 10:50 PM	No	How do I use this skype bullshit
	Oct 2, 2014, 10:54 PM	Yes	Brian what's your username
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	I've used the smartphone app in a pinch
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	Brainmurphy@hotmail.com
	Oct 2, 2014, 10:54 PM	Yes	False
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:55 PM	No	Give Brian Murphy a shot.
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:55 PM	No	I have a profile pic set, so you should be able to find me
	Oct 2, 2014, 10:56 PM	Yes	There's a shitload of you
+13368314649	Oct 2, 2014, 10:56 PM	No	Give me yours then
	Oct 2, 2014, 10:56 PM	Yes	crayraym
	Oct 2, 2014, 11:01 PM	Yes	Eric add me as a contact
+13363914954	Oct 3, 2014, 2:21 PM	No	
+13368314649	Oct 3, 2014, 2:24 PM	No	Yeah when is connor going to switch majors?
	Oct 3, 2014, 2:54 PM	Yes	when I transfer into penn m & t at the end of the year
+13363914954	Oct 3, 2014, 2:58 PM	No	Lololol
+13368314649	Oct 3, 2014, 3:00 PM	No	Btw, connor, you should mess with git and github in the next month if you havent. Eric, you have used it, right?
+13368314649	Oct 3, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	Check out hp idol ondemanf
+13368314649	Oct 3, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	Hp idol ondemand
+13368314649	Oct 7, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	I'm going to need to hitch a ride with you, connor
	Oct 7, 2014, 9:30 PM	Yes	Sweet
+13368314649	Oct 7, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	Do we know when this bullshit starts?
+13363914954	Oct 7, 2014, 11:57 PM	No	HackPrinceton?
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 7:55 AM	No	Yeah
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	I have the best idea. The best one. No way we could do it though
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	Actually... he'll maybe
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	Hell maybe
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:15 PM	No	What if you used Google glass as an html/css renderer? You could look at source code, or a url, and have it pull in images and whatnot to display the page in the viewfinder
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	Hell, at that rate you could just look at a link and have someone display it.
	Oct 8, 2014, 4:25 PM	Yes	I'm not sure I understand how that's beneficial
+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 4:32 PM	No	Do you mean like.. A browser in the glasses?
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:35 PM	No	It would mostly just be cool as fuck. Yes. It would read text markup or code, and render in the viewfinder. It would be a hell of a developer tool. We could probably use it to preview QR code links too
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:37 PM	No	I have doubts surrounding whether it is feasable for a hackathon projext
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:38 PM	No	But still. Imagine opening up your text editor and having the code you look at annotated with useful info. Or writing out a quick script on a napkin and running it to find the answer to some math problem.
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:40 PM	No	"""Hold on, let me work this out... I'm finding all possible solutions and checking to see if yours is the shortest"""
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	Computer viruses via graffiti
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:46 PM	No	Javascript animations on post-it notes
	Oct 8, 2014, 4:48 PM	Yes	Let's do it
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:49 PM	No	Haha can we?
+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 4:53 PM	No	I'm gettin a code-boner. We'll have to write a compiler...? Interpreter?
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	Let's not reinvent any wheels now. I nominate Javascript to be our first supported language because it is lightweight, interpreted (not compiled), and there are already lots of interpreters available.
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 4:59 PM	No	If we had more time, I would say that we should invent our own syntax that would be more readable by a camera. We could write a parser to replace tiny Javascript punctuation with some more readable symbols.
+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	So the keys of this would be OCR, quick parsing, and display?
+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 5:04 PM	No	This would actually be a cool smartphone app...
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 5:07 PM	No	Yeah. We would need to leverage some kind of photo - to - text library in the short run though, so we wouldn't be able to create a custom written syntax for the hackathon. We could still augment the regular Javascript syntax so that we at least don't have to distinguish between colons and semi-colons though.
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 5:08 PM	No	If i were going to make this an actual product, I would do something like this:
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 5:08 PM	No	
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 5:11 PM	No	Alright, I was just thoroughly nerd sniped. I have to study for a psych exam, so let's talk later. Btw, is anyone going to be in NC this weekend?
+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	This idea's already been done on mobile
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 6:43 PM	No	Damn. I even had a language name in mind: cursive.  But that's okay. As I toyed with the idea some more, I thought of something else. You know what I think holds back QR codes a lot? The fact that you can't use write them. You can only consume them. What if we made a writable global link system that was consumed in the same manner as a QR code, but is easily generable by a person whenever he or she wants
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 6:45 PM	No	You wouldn't need a printer to quickly direct someone to online content.
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 6:46 PM	No	Btw, what is the app called? I'm a download that shit
+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	How would you make a QR code without a printer? It's called code to go
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	Well, it wouldn't be a QR code. You would make it out of characters
+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 8:43 PM	No	So... Draw a QR code?
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 10:21 PM	No	Yes
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 10:22 PM	No	I think a georgia state student just bummed cs homework help off of me
+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 10:23 PM	No	How?
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 10:28 PM	No	"He was asking some java questions, but the stuff he was asking was a little fishy. He didn't even know how to loop. Tech's intro class is in python, so I asked him what class he was in. He said the into class... ""the Java version"". He then admitted to being a GSU student because I must not have looked like I believed him."
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 10:29 PM	No	"Also, I am the worst kind of person. I got an email from my psych prof saying that our exam tomorrow was cancelled because she is in the hospital with ""some kidney crap"", and I immediately cheered aloud."
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	She also said that it was rescheduled for next tuesday, which she will have to revise, because we have fall break then
+13363914954	Oct 8, 2014, 10:33 PM	No	You have fall break next week??
+13368314649	Oct 8, 2014, 10:34 PM	No	Yes. Monday and tues. It's why I asked if anyone would be in NC
+13363914954	Oct 9, 2014, 12:05 PM	No	I'm just reading XKCD and your nerd sniping comment from yesterday now makes much more sense hahahahaha
+13368314649	Oct 9, 2014, 12:06 PM	No	Yeah I read it right before saying that
+13363914954	Oct 9, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	Kill that shit
+13363914954	Oct 9, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	On The Attack - Langhorne Slim
+13368314649	Oct 9, 2014, 9:13 PM	No	Exactly which shit am I to kill?
+13363914954	Oct 10, 2014, 11:23 AM	No	The message I was going for was that Langhorne is killing the metaphorical shit in this song
+13368314649	Oct 10, 2014, 11:27 AM	No	"She's gone has some funny ones. ""I put on a happy face on Halloween an scare the shit outa the ghosts"""
+13368314649	Oct 11, 2014, 3:48 PM	No	"So I heard that ""princeton ' s Mitchell"" won a tournament as a freshman"
+13363914954	Oct 11, 2014, 4:46 PM	No	Haha, yeah, that happened
+13368314649	Oct 12, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	"Mr funk spat out his corn flakes when he read that you said ""very unique"" in your interview."
+13363914954	Oct 12, 2014, 4:55 PM	No	Why? Is that bad?
+13368314649	Oct 12, 2014, 4:58 PM	No	Unique: there is only one of these. Very unique: there is.... wait.
+13368314649	Oct 12, 2014, 4:58 PM	No	That was Mr funk thing anyway
+13363914954	Oct 17, 2014, 4:08 PM	No	Wanna talk this weekend?
	Oct 17, 2014, 4:09 PM	Yes	Who's the other guy on our team?
+13368314649	Oct 17, 2014, 4:09 PM	No	Yeah. When is good?
+13368314649	Oct 17, 2014, 4:12 PM	No	There's a fourth?
+13368314649	Oct 17, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	Beep beep
+13363914954	Oct 17, 2014, 4:23 PM	No	A guy interested in CS that I know. He's decently experienced in web development
+13368314649	Oct 17, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	Cool. Cuando hablaramos?
+13368314649	Oct 17, 2014, 4:33 PM	No	Beep beep
+13363914954	Oct 17, 2014, 5:21 PM	No	Tomorrow?
+13368314649	Oct 17, 2014, 5:22 PM	No	Yeah
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 3:39 PM	No	Hey guys, I had an idea today.
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 3:40 PM	No	Me too. Ramen noodles aren't that good dry
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 3:41 PM	No	Ew
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 3:42 PM	No	Unless you melt cheese on them
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 3:42 PM	No	Sorry, real idea?
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 3:44 PM	No	I think we could make an app that is some kind of 'game' that measures your BAC
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 3:44 PM	No	Propane pro for alcohol, if you will
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 3:44 PM	No	Kegs?
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 3:45 PM	No	Testing this one is going to be WAY better
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 3:48 PM	No	Hahahaha it's just an idea
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 3:51 PM	No	Are we going to use the sound technology or just estimate bac from user input?
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 3:52 PM	No	Do you have any ideas for the game?
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 3:57 PM	No	Guys the weather in atlanta is so nice right now that I am getting the opposite of seasonal disaffected disorder
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	Sound technology?
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	It wouldn't be a real game, it would just essentially test reflexes and motion-tracking ability
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 4:02 PM	No	Ooh that does sound fun actually. And we could steal the speech jammer functionality.
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 4:06 PM	No	Ohhh yeah
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 4:14 PM	No	"We could also just have fun with the interface. The content rating is mature, so I picture dialogs with titles like, ""Hey, Bitch"""
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 4:39 PM	No	Ha, for now I'm just curious if the concept could work at all
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 4:52 PM	No	Yeah idk. It would take testing....
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 5:22 PM	No	Wanna Skype at some point? Maybe get this BS figured out?
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 5:25 PM	No	Yeah, like after dinner tonight perhaps?
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 5:26 PM	No	Okay. Sounds good
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 5:27 PM	No	What time is that?
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 6:52 PM	No	Probably 9-10?
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	Oh okay
	Oct 18, 2014, 6:53 PM	Yes	I'm probably going to be hammered by then
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 6:55 PM	No	Wonderful
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 9:07 PM	No	Talk soon ya?
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 9:28 PM	No	Wanna sky -pee
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 9:28 PM	No	Or skype
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 9:28 PM	No	Or respond
+13363914954	Oct 18, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	Ayy sorry, I'm in a study session because we have midterms this week. Can we do tomorrow instead? Sorry
+13368314649	Oct 18, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	Yeah
+13363914954	Oct 19, 2014, 2:32 PM	No	Bitches, skype?
+13368314649	Oct 19, 2014, 2:34 PM	No	Yes
	Oct 19, 2014, 2:38 PM	Yes	Now?
+13363914954	Oct 19, 2014, 2:38 PM	No	Yes now
+13368314649	Oct 19, 2014, 2:38 PM	No	Yes
	Oct 19, 2014, 2:39 PM	Yes	Okay
+13363914954	Oct 20, 2014, 12:34 AM	No	There's gold the ceiling
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 12:49 AM	No	Black keys or drunk?
	Oct 20, 2014, 12:51 AM	Yes	Brian howd that fire turn out?
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 12:53 AM	No	Idk, somebody probably microwaved some popcorn for a multiple of ten longer than they intended. We got back in in less than 20 mins. Wasn't even late to the review session
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 12:56 AM	No	My roomate got back in town. Unfortunately he didn't die in a hazing accident. Sleeping when I wanted was nice.
	Oct 20, 2014, 12:57 AM	Yes	Haha that's a little bit aggressive Brian 
+13363914954	Oct 20, 2014, 12:57 AM	No	That's horrific
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 12:59 AM	No	Thankfully it's also sarcastic. He might be biasing me against him by shouting at me for not knowing when his finals are. Also just shouting in general. He's probably still a little drunk.
+13363914954	Oct 20, 2014, 1:00 AM	No	Ah that's good.
	Oct 20, 2014, 1:00 AM	Yes	Sunday fun day?
+13363914954	Oct 20, 2014, 1:00 AM	No	#goodtobeinasingle
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:01 AM	No	He has been on some kind of fraternity initiation trip all weekend. But yeah, eric, we're you quoting the black keys?
+13363914954	Oct 20, 2014, 1:02 AM	No	Yes I were, way into that shit at the moment
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:04 AM	No	I would have recommended that to you a year ago if I had known you weren't aware. I have a Brothers poster on my wall back in winston
+13363914954	Oct 20, 2014, 1:04 AM	No	Yeah I never checked them out that seriously. Now it's just like yum so delicious
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:04 AM	No	Brothers = my fav album by them
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:05 AM	No	Oh my god my roomate must have eaten 3000 calories of almond joy
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:06 AM	No	
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:07 AM	No	Call it almond extasy
+13363914954	Oct 20, 2014, 1:07 AM	No	Ew that's gross
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:07 AM	No	Ecstasy?
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:09 AM	No	He's Def drunk. Now pacing the room talking to himself. And he's not even being polite to him, either.
	Oct 20, 2014, 1:13 AM	Yes	I'm really glad that I like my roommate 
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:13 AM	No	"Lol now going through his backlog of stuff to do, asking lots of ""why cant?"" Questions."
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:14 AM	No	Has now absolutely given up, turned off the lights, and might be crying in bed. Okay I kinda feel bad for him now.
	Oct 20, 2014, 1:15 AM	Yes	Haha he's probably pretty close to dead after a full weekend of hazing
+13368314649	Oct 20, 2014, 1:15 AM	No	Anyway, looks like I can sleep now. Nite.
+13363914954	Oct 22, 2014, 4:04 PM	No	Holy fuck have you guys seen chordify.net?
+13368314649	Oct 22, 2014, 4:05 PM	No	Nah
+13363914954	Oct 22, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	It's takes any audio file or youtube link and computes the rhythm and chords on the fly. Pretty badass
+13368314649	Oct 22, 2014, 4:52 PM	No	That could be super cool
+13368314649	Oct 25, 2014, 9:27 AM	No	I'm at hackNC (UNC). Took a self in front of the Chapel Hill chapel and immediately saw three FCDS people. This is weird. This is wierd
+13363914954	Oct 25, 2014, 10:51 AM	No	Hahahahaha who was there?
+13368314649	Oct 25, 2014, 11:43 AM	No	I haven't seen anyone at the actual event yet. I saw  Brynlee Parker, David Westbrook, and  Will Whitehurst while walking around campus before check in
+13368314649	Oct 28, 2014, 11:27 PM	No	Hey, after going to a hackathon this weekend, I learned a few things about the types of projects that did well, and got a pretty good feeling for what is possible in that amount of time.
+13368314649	Oct 28, 2014, 11:32 PM	No	For instance, the overall winner was some bullshit wishy washy safety app, but the project that got the most awards was sandwich box. basically, they wired this wooden box with a button that hooked up to an arduino which hooked up wirelessly to a computer. The box was kinda intimidating, in that it had one of those safety buttons that they fire nukes with in movies. When you press the button, it orders a jimmy Johns sandwich to your location. They did a man in the middle attack on themselves to igure out how to post to the jimmy Johns online order thing, and sure enough, the sandwich came.
+13368314649	Oct 28, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	So the project can be goofy and still do well.
+13363914954	Oct 28, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	Ha, that's ridiculous. But entertaining. Any new inspiration?
+13368314649	Oct 28, 2014, 11:47 PM	No	I was thinking of an app that queries commonly misspelled words on twitter, and replies to the tweets by correcting the spelling automatically. Haha
+13368314649	Oct 28, 2014, 11:49 PM	No	We could use a little bit more complex grammar analysis stuff and start telling people the difference between your and you're, too. Kinda funny
+13363914954	Oct 29, 2014, 11:04 AM	No	Hahaha that actually would be funny, except if it were ever wrong it'd be awk
+13368314649	Oct 29, 2014, 11:06 AM	No	Yeah. Good thing we're never wrong
+13363914954	Oct 29, 2014, 11:30 AM	No	Ah yes, I forgot!
+13363914954	Oct 29, 2014, 11:30 AM	No	How would we do this again?
+13368314649	Oct 29, 2014, 2:42 PM	No	Twitter api.
+13368314649	Oct 29, 2014, 2:42 PM	No	But it's just another idea on the board y'know.
+13368314649	Oct 30, 2014, 9:15 PM	No	We are essentially two weeks out. Wanna figure out what we are doing
+13363914954	Oct 30, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	Yes. I will be back at school tomorrow night, so this weekend? Time to do some serious figuring.
+13368314649	Oct 30, 2014, 9:24 PM	No	Yeah. Saturday night is bad for me. I'm going to be at a local hack night.
	Oct 30, 2014, 9:25 PM	Yes	I'm gonna be hammered
+13368314649	Oct 30, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	All weekend?
+13368314649	Oct 30, 2014, 9:26 PM	No	Even like 10am?
+13363914954	Oct 30, 2014, 9:26 PM	No	#alcoholism
+13368314649	Oct 30, 2014, 9:26 PM	No	I guess at that point hungover...
	Oct 30, 2014, 9:26 PM	Yes	It's Halloween bro, and haha maybe I could do that
+13368314649	Oct 30, 2014, 9:28 PM	No	You can make anything an ism. Eric is an anti-alcoholismist, for example. I mean we aren't vampires, so we could do it during the day Friday if connor can hold off until dusk.
+13368314649	Oct 30, 2014, 9:28 PM	No	My classes end at 12
+13363914954	Oct 31, 2014, 12:52 AM	No	
+13368314649	Oct 31, 2014, 7:57 AM	No	Lol second bud pic of this weekend
+13368314649	Nov 2, 2014, 11:21 PM	No	I just listened to 'speak plainly diana' and cracked the fuck up when he said I don't mind riding around
+13363914954	Nov 2, 2014, 11:23 PM	No	It's something that's important to him
+13368314649	Nov 2, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	Like, we fucking asked him about that. We joked with the writer of one of my all time favorite songs about its lyrics.
+13363914954	Nov 2, 2014, 11:28 PM	No	 I know! Fucking crazy. He was so cool.
+13368314649	Nov 2, 2014, 11:30 PM	No	Yeah. How was everyone's weekend?
+13363914954	Nov 2, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	Pretty good. Getting back into the work mode after spring break. Trying to brainstorm a little bit. For some reason I can't ftp into the site right now, I get timeouts. Any idea why?
+13368314649	Nov 2, 2014, 11:34 PM	No	None. I can check it out though
+13368314649	Nov 2, 2014, 11:34 PM	No	Also, your spring break comes really early.
+13368314649	Nov 2, 2014, 11:34 PM	No	Lololol
+13363914954	Nov 2, 2014, 11:40 PM	No	Lol, fall break
+13368314649	Nov 2, 2014, 11:44 PM	No	Yeah. Kill those bears?
+13368314649	Nov 2, 2014, 11:44 PM	No	Beers
+13363914954	Nov 2, 2014, 11:48 PM	No	A few. Learned an interesting new drinking game
+13368314649	Nov 2, 2014, 11:48 PM	No	Yeah?
+13363914954	Nov 2, 2014, 11:55 PM	No	Yeah, it's like ring of fire, but using a quarte
+13363914954	Nov 2, 2014, 11:55 PM	No	Quarter
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:00 AM	No	That sounds rough. I do well at ring of fire. Might have something to do with the fact that mostly girls play it.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:18 AM	No	Anyway, do you guys want to decide on the project beforehand or nah?
	Nov 3, 2014, 12:21 AM	Yes	Nah, makes things more interesting, Brian are we still taking the train together from philly?
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 12:22 AM	No	Yes, but not right now. I'll be brainstorming this week.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:24 AM	No	Nah I got an excuse for my test and it was cheaper to hit trenton. I hope your travels go better than mine did last weekend.
	Nov 3, 2014, 12:27 AM	Yes	When are you getting there? 
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:30 AM	No	Arriving in trenton at 7:53 Am.
	Nov 3, 2014, 12:32 AM	Yes	When should I get there?
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:32 AM	No	...which I am just now realizing is going to conflict with eric's classes.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:34 AM	No	I could take a four hour walk there, provided it isn't too snowy, or I could rely on local public transit. Looks like I'll have to hedge my bets, but if it were a two hour walk....
	Nov 3, 2014, 12:34 AM	Yes	Eric when does shit start?
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:36 AM	No	7pm is opening ceremony
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:37 AM	No	Which should give me plenty of time to lurk around princeton university. If you've never lurked around someone else's campus you should. It's invigorating
	Nov 3, 2014, 12:38 AM	Yes	I may show up and lurk with you then, unfortunately I have class from 3 to 4
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:40 AM	No	Blow that shit off. You are totally going to be late if you go
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:41 AM	No	Even if your train gets there with laser precision, you're going to have to get to campus.
	Nov 3, 2014, 12:42 AM	Yes	I would like to, but not sure I can, there's only 8 people in the class so I'd have to actually ask. Also there's a train that leaves at five and gets there at 612
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:43 AM	No	I got an institute excuse for a test I had that day. But whatevs
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:44 AM	No	It better not be a goddamn blizzard.
	Nov 3, 2014, 12:44 AM	Yes	Yeah, the problem is that it's a weird business school class where our grade is arbitrated by the TA at the end of the semester, so if he says no I can't 
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:46 AM	No	Dude, if you can't pitch a hackathon in a way that sounds educationally relevant, you should consider another major than business.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:47 AM	No	Btw, don't group projects suck? More specifically, don't group project members suck?
	Nov 3, 2014, 12:50 AM	Yes	Haha not worried about that part Brian, they just really don't like you missing their shit here, for any reason, and not here, everyone cares a shitload and I rarely have to do anything
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:50 AM	No	Sorry, venting. I've got a free Azure trial that will still be active during hackprinceton, fyu
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:50 AM	No	Fyi
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:51 AM	No	So you are those guys. Is that what you're trying to tell me? Cause I hear you loud and clear buddy boy
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:51 AM	No	Jk. But seriously. But jk.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:55 AM	No	I should sleep. Falling asleep in calculus has been producing some really confounding notes. Also, if yall get the chance to check out lambda expressions in java, they allow you to create the most beautifully concise, entirely incomprehensible code you have ever seen. Write once, read never.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:59 AM	No	Good luck on public transportation btw. If trains in the north are anything like busses in the south, then I'll refer you o the song A Thousand Men by Joe pug for what to expect.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 1:00 AM	No	"Southern night-busses: ""every good idea kills at least a thousand men"""
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 10:06 AM	No	Ha, reading this conversation is hilarious
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 10:07 AM	No	It becomes more wall ball than ping pong near the end.
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 10:48 AM	No	I have class at 9, I might be able to pick you up
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 10:49 AM	No	K
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 10:51 AM	No	"Lots of lols @ ""Dude, if you can't pitch a hackathon in a way that sounds educationally relevant, you should consider another major than business.l"
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 10:51 AM	No	""""
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 10:53 AM	No	Heh sorry connor. Making fun of business majors at GT has become habit.
	Nov 3, 2014, 11:00 AM	Yes	Haha Brian, business degrees are a joke, until you slap a wharton label on them and pick up just about any job you want. Also I'm getting a CS degree as well so I actually learn something in college
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 11:01 AM	No	Cs iz fun
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 11:01 AM	No	Gt makes it really nice to be cs. I am coding a text adventure for my english final project
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 11:02 AM	No	 Lol casual double major. I'm triple majoring in Econ CS and Chemical Engineering
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 11:03 AM	No	Seriously?
	Nov 3, 2014, 11:03 AM	Yes	No
	Nov 3, 2014, 11:03 AM	Yes	Princeton doesn't do that
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 11:03 AM	No	I would assume that was a joke from anyone but eric
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 11:05 AM	No	Btw I look forward to seeing your businessing skills in action connor. Oh wait...
	Nov 3, 2014, 11:12 AM	Yes	Fuck you Brian, I've developed a lot of useful skills here, how to dress well, how to spend a lot, and how to be so well connected that it really couldn't matter less that I don't actually have any useful skills
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 12:03 PM	No	Someone's gotta do it. I salute you for your sacrifices, connor
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 1:20 PM	No	Lol cool it bitches
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 1:21 PM	No	It's all for lols.
	Nov 3, 2014, 1:36 PM	Yes	Yes it is, eric are you still going to be at princeton this weekend? Apparently this game is a really big deal
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 1:40 PM	No	Haha google doesn't even have a widget for yall football teams when you search them
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 1:41 PM	No	Do real live white people play for yall?
	Nov 3, 2014, 1:46 PM	Yes	Yeah no fake dead black people for sure
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 1:48 PM	No	Seems like you guys managed to loose ON YOUR HOMECOMING  to BROWN. I had to do a lot of digging to actually find yall schedule.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 1:48 PM	No	Not to be outdone, Princeton managed to lose to a toothpaste
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 1:51 PM	No	So yes, this game will be a big deal. I think FCDS is thinking about joining yall's  devision based on the result.
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 2:50 PM	No	Hey Brian fuck you!!!!!!
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 2:50 PM	No	I will be here this weekend, yes
	Nov 3, 2014, 3:10 PM	Yes	I might make a day trip then
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 3:12 PM	No	Omg yesh
	Nov 3, 2014, 5:07 PM	Yes	Will you get belligerently drunk with me if I do?
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 5:39 PM	No	Potentially. We might be having a golf dealio in the evening, but if not we can visit the street and you can see the... Finer side of the Princeton nightlife. Maybe. I'm actually not sure what the deal is with guests on the street.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 5:41 PM	No	Connor isn't a guest. He's a princeton student
	Nov 3, 2014, 5:42 PM	Yes	Yeah I transferred last week actually Eric. What is the street? 
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 5:43 PM	No	Haha impossible! Princeton doesn't accept transfers
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 5:43 PM	No	The street is like frat row, I guess. But not frat houses, just clubs that host parties
	Nov 3, 2014, 5:47 PM	Yes	You just gotta blow the right people Eric, and are you in an eating club yet?
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 5:47 PM	No	That seems bizarre. But seeing that they obviously don't take id, I don't see why connor can't attend princeton by virtue of saying so
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 6:09 PM	No	You have to show Princeton ID to get in.
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 6:09 PM	No	You can't join until sophomore spring.
	Nov 3, 2014, 6:17 PM	Yes	Eric I think that they do that to make sure you're not a cop. And damn that's a long wait
+13363914954	Nov 3, 2014, 6:18 PM	No	Haha no they don't. This is Princeton, the police don't care. These clubs aren't secretive or anything. They have their own security guys at the door making sure random people aren't coming in.
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 6:29 PM	No	I'll be able to drink legally by sophomore summer. Psyched
	Nov 3, 2014, 6:30 PM	Yes	Eric it's the same here, but undercover cops still show up
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 6:35 PM	No	No cops get into our frat parties. Mostly because nobody gets into our frat parties
	Nov 3, 2014, 6:41 PM	Yes	Haha your lucky Eric, they Id at all registered frat parties
	Nov 3, 2014, 6:41 PM	Yes	Here
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 6:42 PM	No	Tight sphincter
	Nov 3, 2014, 6:43 PM	Yes	Ehh, everyone on campus has a fake so it doesn't really matter
+13368314649	Nov 3, 2014, 6:44 PM	No	Connor wouldn't get carded. Looks at least 26
+13368314649	Nov 4, 2014, 7:14 PM	No	"We had to turn in a proposal for a group project in english class, and we are doing a text adventure.

+13368314649	Nov 4, 2014, 9:16 PM	No	K
+13368314649	Nov 4, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	Also, Erik wince is having a baby
+13368314649	Nov 4, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	Well, his wife is
+13363914954	Nov 4, 2014, 9:25 PM	No	Wow, that's strange
+13368314649	Nov 4, 2014, 9:26 PM	No	That baby is going to be one helluva athlete with his parents
+13368314649	Nov 4, 2014, 9:28 PM	No	Write it down. He is going to be an NCAA  all-american
+13368314649	Nov 4, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	What if it were a girl? I am having trouble picturing Wince having a son, but a daughter... Damn.
+13363914954	Nov 4, 2014, 10:12 PM	No	Poor girl
+13368314649	Nov 4, 2014, 10:35 PM	No	Haha
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 12:06 AM	No	Can we make an app that tells you when you are driving past a house where a Satan worshipper sacrifices animals and buried human remains
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 12:07 AM	No	Cause I could have used an app like that when I was dropping off a west forsyth friend last year
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 12:08 AM	No	If none of that made sense, look up Pazuzu Algarad
	Nov 6, 2014, 12:08 AM	Yes	I don't get it
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 12:09 AM	No	Look up Pazuzu Algarad, and then put his address into Google maps.
	Nov 6, 2014, 12:09 AM	Yes	No
+13363914954	Nov 6, 2014, 5:47 PM	No	It's all over facebook. Fackin crazy, man
+13363914954	Nov 6, 2014, 5:47 PM	No	How about an app that takes a chunk of text and shows the geography referenced in it in chronological order?
+13363914954	Nov 6, 2014, 5:48 PM	No	So you can show the movement of a character in a book or the references in a song
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 5:48 PM	No	Haha splain
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 5:49 PM	No	That sounds cool
+13363914954	Nov 6, 2014, 5:53 PM	No	There might be some grammar analysis involved
+13363914954	Nov 6, 2014, 5:54 PM	No	Or you can make a dash cam app that you can tap when you're behind a bad driver and so you could make a real time bad driver database
+13363914954	Nov 6, 2014, 5:54 PM	No	Or you can use some sentiment analysis to come up with asshole/inflammatory ratings for everyone on your friends list on facebook
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 5:57 PM	No	Haha i don't need an app for that. I kinda like the first one. It has a lot of wall space for tacking on cool features. Like you could make it cross reference artist biographies and their works to provide relevant info to the comprehension of the work
	Nov 6, 2014, 6:04 PM	Yes	 Brian you'd get such a high rating
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 6:07 PM	No	Ha I thought about saying that. In reality I don't use Facebook enough for it to work in that realm. My rating would span from hitler to Satan depending on whether you analyzed twitter or yik yak
+13363914954	Nov 6, 2014, 6:08 PM	No	Yeah, so it could be an allusion-explainer for literature or music
+13363914954	Nov 6, 2014, 6:08 PM	No	That would be pretty sweet
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 6:15 PM	No	I had an idea as well. At HackNC this one team had to go through a technical process in order to find the get and post requests to operate a website that did not have an API automatically. I was thinking that we could create a product that automates this process. It will find the request format for products without a public facing API. So you could like, automatically order pizzas and shit
+13368314649	Nov 6, 2014, 6:15 PM	No	Although I must say, that isn't my favorite pizza topping
+13363914954	Nov 7, 2014, 5:12 PM	No	That's an extremely intriguing idea. How feasible do you think it is? I'm trying to run some preliminary tests on the allusion finder with a chapter from Crime and Punishment
+13368314649	Nov 7, 2014, 5:13 PM	No	Lol eric you realize that's cheating, right?
+13363914954	Nov 7, 2014, 5:13 PM	No	How's that cheating?
+13368314649	Nov 7, 2014, 5:14 PM	No	You aren't supposed to start working on it beforehand
+13368314649	Nov 7, 2014, 5:20 PM	No	Whatever though. Wanna talk today?
	Nov 7, 2014, 6:04 PM	Yes	I've got time now, possibly later
+13368314649	Nov 7, 2014, 6:19 PM	No	Eriiiic
+13368314649	Nov 7, 2014, 9:38 PM	No	
+13368314649	Nov 7, 2014, 9:39 PM	No	Idk what made him think that was a good idea
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 6:05 PM	No	Guise
	Nov 8, 2014, 7:04 PM	Yes	Yeah?
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 7:05 PM	No	Wanna do stuff?
	Nov 8, 2014, 7:28 PM	Yes	What kind of stuff?
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 7:29 PM	No	Maybe get a handle of what technology we'll be using so that everyone can at least run through a couple Node.js tutorials or whatever
	Nov 8, 2014, 7:30 PM	Yes	Skype?
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 7:31 PM	No	Y 0
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 7:31 PM	No	(Why not)
	Nov 8, 2014, 7:36 PM	Yes	Okay
+13363914954	Nov 8, 2014, 7:36 PM	No	I'm in
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 7:41 PM	No	RICK
+13363914954	Nov 8, 2014, 7:44 PM	No	 Gimme ten, sorry!
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 7:44 PM	No	Np
+13363914954	Nov 8, 2014, 9:31 PM	No	Hey guys, Luis and I found an open source Firefox add-on that monitors http requests, responses, and parameters. Importantly, it's open source, and the code is available online. It's written in JavaScript
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 9:34 PM	No	Yay! JS
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 9:36 PM	No	You could say I've picked up a JS addiction since going g to tech. I started using just to fit in, but now it has become a habit. I must have done a hundred lines of it this week
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 9:36 PM	No	Giggles. Wanna add Luis to this convo ?
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 10:06 PM	No	I guess this means I'll have to download firefox
+13368314649	Nov 8, 2014, 10:49 PM	No	If you just open up the chrome debugger you can see some cool shit
+13363914954	Nov 9, 2014, 1:01 PM	No	Yeah but the difference is this is open source
+13368314649	Nov 9, 2014, 1:03 PM	No	I mean you can access all that info by making a chrome web extension though. Idk if the Firefox code will work outside of the realm of firefox, but if we are going to embed this thing in a browser I would rather it be chrome than firefox.
+13368314649	Nov 12, 2014, 7:05 PM	No	Did you guys see that link I sent you on facebook
+13363914954	Nov 13, 2014, 8:29 AM	No	Wow.... #4 is us
+13368314649	Nov 13, 2014, 8:31 AM	No	Yeah
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 8:24 AM	No	Hey eric I'm in ptown
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 8:24 AM	No	Where to meet?
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 8:27 AM	No	Well I'm about to leave for a 9 am. Where are you?
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 8:28 AM	No	There are castles everywhere?
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 8:29 AM	No	I'm gonna hang with my gt bro until you're done
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 8:32 AM	No	I can leave my door unlocked if you want
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 8:33 AM	No	I wouldn't know how to get there anyway
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 8:45 AM	No	It's not that bad, it's pretty central on campus. I can send you the location. If not, I'll be out at 11
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 8:48 AM	No	I have to leave for class now. You wouldn't be able to get in the building without a key anyway. I'll see you at eleven! I hope the travel was okay.
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 8:49 AM	No	Twas
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 9:59 AM	No	Food for thought: the .NET platform went open source and cross platform two days ago
	Nov 14, 2014, 10:01 AM	Yes	Brian do I need dressier clothes for the presentation portion of this?
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 10:03 AM	No	Absolutely no
	Nov 14, 2014, 10:05 AM	Yes	Aight, also for travel reimbursement do I just need to show them ticket stubs and receipts?
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 10:07 AM	No	I guess
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 10:54 AM	No	Yeah I saw that, seemed surprising
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 10:55 AM	No	Connor are you here?
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 10:55 AM	No	It's weird to see a Microsoft github reo
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 10:55 AM	No	Repo
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 10:56 AM	No	Brian, I'm out of class
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 10:56 AM	No	Meet me at witherspoon hall
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 10:56 AM	No	"""Hey look, we have more commits than .net"" k"
	Nov 14, 2014, 10:57 AM	Yes	Nah, I probably won't get there until around 3ish
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 10:58 AM	No	Alright, do some brainstorming if you've got free time. If we can solve the computational equivalent of world hunger this weekend that'd be nice
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 11:00 AM	No	
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 11:00 AM	No	Where are you. Iran?
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 11:01 AM	No	Brian?*
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 11:06 AM	No	I'm in front of witherspoon
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 11:13 AM	No	Wifi?
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 11:13 AM	No	puvisitor 
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 11:13 AM	No	K
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 11:49 AM	No	Hey, my buddy wants to know if you can get into the library as a visitor?
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 11:54 AM	No	Hmm. Good question. I think he'd need a prox just to open the door, but if someone let him in he might be able to tell the security guys that he's here for HackPrinceton and they may let him in.
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 11:54 AM	No	Is he here with a team?
+13368314649	Nov 14, 2014, 11:54 AM	No	Nope
	Nov 14, 2014, 12:46 PM	Yes	Haha it's going to cost me more that you to get there Brian 
+13363914954	Nov 14, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	How much?
	Nov 14, 2014, 12:51 PM	Yes	So far I'm at 52 bucks and that will get me to Trenton, haven't figured out the rest yet

+17344782101	May 31, 2014, 7:25 PM	Yes	And morals, I'm pretty sure it's illegal for us to go to these things at this point
+13367757093	May 31, 2014, 7:25 PM	No	Illegal, shmillegal...

+13368165198	Jun 3, 2014, 3:54 PM	No	Do y'all want to smoke cigars tonight?
+17344782101	Jun 3, 2014, 4:45 PM	Yes	Maybe, depends on whether or not bowling is happening
+13368165198	Jun 3, 2014, 4:48 PM	No	Aight, Evan?
+13364068233	Jun 3, 2014, 5:34 PM	No	Maybe, what bowling?
+13368165198	Jun 3, 2014, 5:36 PM	No	I'm at dinner with two Stanford admits
+13364068233	Jun 3, 2014, 5:39 PM	No	Damn you stud
+17344782101	Jun 3, 2014, 5:39 PM	Yes	Ouch, jay where is beach week?
+17344782101	Jun 3, 2014, 5:41 PM	Yes	And two dollar Tuesdays, a groups been going the past couple of weeks
+13368165198	Jun 3, 2014, 5:54 PM	No	Myrtle beach 
+13364068233	Jun 3, 2014, 5:58 PM	No	Oh yea that group
+13368165198	Jun 3, 2014, 7:47 PM	No	Are you going bowling mounts?
+17344782101	Jun 3, 2014, 7:52 PM	Yes	No, but I'm playing a family game, what time were you thinking?
+13368165198	Jun 3, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	More like 10 I actually need to get my amp from your house
+17344782101	Jun 3, 2014, 8:15 PM	Yes	Yeah, that be a good idea
+13368165198	Jun 3, 2014, 8:14 PM	No	Can we do it at your house? Mine house is good if you want to bring my amp
+17344782101	Jun 3, 2014, 8:34 PM	Yes	My house is fine
+13368165198	Jun 3, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	Your dad can join in
+17344782101	Jun 3, 2014, 8:35 PM	Yes	Haha maybe, he'll probably asleep, he wasn't feeling great
+13368165198	Jun 3, 2014, 8:46 PM	No	That's a bummer
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 6:33 PM	No	Welcome to the beach week alcohol group chat. We need to decide who is getting their own alcohol and who needs to get together as a group to buy in bulk. If you already know someone who can buy for others and will then let us know
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 6:34 PM	No	Isn't it illegal to have alcohol? 
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 6:35 PM	No	Not on private property in South Carolina 
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	I was joking. I feel like we should all go in together and stock the fridge full 
+13364036025	Jun 4, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	Who is 704?
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	You have a shrewd knowledge of interstate alcohol laws, that is correct  
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	E dawg
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	My dad has me covered but I doubt he'd buy for others so maybe I'll just... oh robbie is in the chat!
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 6:36 PM	No	Yep
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 6:37 PM	No	Haha! Nice
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 6:37 PM	No	So Brian is covered. Does anyone else have themselves covered?
	Jun 4, 2014, 6:38 PM	Yes	I say no food, only alcohol in the fridge
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 6:38 PM	No	I could use some help
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 6:39 PM	No	Send me a text out of the group chat with what you want and the sizes
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 6:40 PM	No	Ok sounds good
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	Okay me and mounts will stock the fridge 
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 6:59 PM	No	So no one likes the stockig the fridge idea? 
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 6:59 PM	No	I do
+13368132145	Jun 4, 2014, 6:59 PM	No	Let's do it
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	If you want to buy me booze I think it's a stellar idea
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	What does that mean?
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	I'll cover you guys food if you can stock for me
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	We would spilt the cost you cheap bastard 
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:00 PM	Yes	Yeah, I'm a split the cost guy as well
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:01 PM	No	... you have to hope.
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 7:01 PM	No	I'm fine with that, could you get specific stuff if I asked?
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	Are we buying as a group?
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:02 PM	Yes	Probably not, noble doesn't have the balls to go to the liquor store
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	Everyone puts money into a pot. I take care of beer and jay takes care of liquor (if he can). We all pay equally so anyone can take whatever they want for themselves. And only people in the house can have access. 
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	I think they are buying as a group minus myself.
+13368132145	Jun 4, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	Agreed. Save the receipts and split the cost
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	So one has to worry about stealing and we are all on the same page 
+13364068233	Jun 4, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	Sure
+13364068233	Jun 4, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	I think that's a good plan
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	Cool 
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:04 PM	No	Ha I won't have to worry about stealing because It's gonna be in my hands all day
+13368132145	Jun 4, 2014, 7:04 PM	No	Sound like we've got it figured out? 
+13364068233	Jun 4, 2014, 7:04 PM	No	But we need to keep it for our house, and make sure no one takes any from us
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:04 PM	No	Brian not all of us are alcoholics like you
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:04 PM	No	Yeah I will bring a chain and lock 
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:05 PM	No	Fridge with beer and freezer with liquor 
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:05 PM	Yes	Can we not get shitty beer?
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 7:05 PM	No	Evan only wants to pay equally because he drinks twice as much as everyone else
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	No
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	Can we get some hard cider?
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	I take it easy 
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	I am going to keep mine in my car, but that presents problems for a group. You put a lock on a plastic trunk for the main stock and then refrigerate the rest as needed.
+13364086079	Jun 4, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	Why would we want shitty beer? 
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:07 PM	Yes	David, that was phrased in such a way that my point is the same as yours
+13368132145	Jun 4, 2014, 7:07 PM	No	Because it's cheap
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:07 PM	Yes	Not phrased emphasized, you just couldn't tell because it's a text
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:07 PM	No	"Everyone that is in say ""hell yeah"" with your name because I don't have half your guys numbers "
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:07 PM	Yes	I want nice beer
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:07 PM	No	Yes mounts 
+13364086079	Jun 4, 2014, 7:07 PM	No	Oh haha yeah nevermind 
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	How bout no. Brian
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:08 PM	Yes	How bout Brian stop bragging about the fact that you have liquor all set and don't participate in a conversation that does you really pertain to you
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:09 PM	Yes	Not*
+13364036025	Jun 4, 2014, 7:09 PM	No	How bout no. Avery
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:09 PM	No	Yeah what mounts said 
+13364086079	Jun 4, 2014, 7:09 PM	No	How about nah. David 
+17046570257	Jun 4, 2014, 7:09 PM	No	Well fuck this 
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:09 PM	Yes	How about we work with Evan, because he's the only one with a fake last I checked
+13368132145	Jun 4, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	Agreed
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	Alrighty.... first one more thing does anyone want cigars? It's not like we need some special connection but i can bring some left over nice ones from my previous trip real cheap
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 7:11 PM	No	I have myself covered there
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:12 PM	No	Ha new group chat everybody
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 7:13 PM	No	FYI the rental agreement says that we can only drive three cars down and one of those is mine 
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:13 PM	No	I call one.
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 7:13 PM	No	I just got a wrangler soft top, any takers on that
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 7:18 PM	No	It's not a calling dibs thing, pick whoever can hold the most in their car
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 7:19 PM	No	I was just seeing if anyone was interested, I could care less provided I get there
+13364036025	Jun 4, 2014, 7:19 PM	No	Well if you're taking your car jay then the next biggest cars are probably tommy guns and mounts if they wana drive
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 7:19 PM	No	I'm just going to go every man for himself instead of buying as a group
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:20 PM	Yes	Agreed, we want the biggest cars, and I think one of the drivers should be willing to leave early, also I can't drive I'm flying out a day early
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 7:21 PM	No	I have to drive because I have to go to the airport on Wednesday because I'm flying to DC and coming back a day later, otherwise I would never take my car
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:21 PM	No	Ok it just seemed like a dibs thing the way you asserted it. Does it say we can only drive three down or only park three, cause that is kinda weird
	Jun 4, 2014, 7:23 PM	Yes	Park three, but there's probably not gonna be a whole lot of empty spaces down there
+13368165198	Jun 4, 2014, 7:23 PM	No	Only park three at the house
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 7:24 PM	No	Maybe we do two cars with 3 people each then one car with two people and peoples bags
+13368314649	Jun 4, 2014, 7:26 PM	No	Okay. Well I'm going to the beach the week before and might not be staying the entire time, so I'll pay for parking if necissary. I'll take any bags you guys wanna drop with me though.
+14235983552	Jun 4, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:15 PM	No	The rental company just offered us an upgrade that has parking for 6 cars, a dock, and direct access to the beach for no additional cost. The house and bedrooms are way nicer and so is the tv but I don't know if it's close to the other people. I just asked
+17046570257	Jun 7, 2014, 4:15 PM	No	Yes
+13364036025	Jun 7, 2014, 4:16 PM	No	That sounds awesome just figure out how close it is broski
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 4:16 PM	No	Screw other people, with a house like that they'll come to us
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:17 PM	No	We don't want them coming to us
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 4:17 PM	Yes	Yeah, but take it anyways, walking is really not a big deal 
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 4:17 PM	No	Fine even better to be far away then
+13364036025	Jun 7, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	But we don't wana be too far away lol
+13364036025	Jun 7, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	Walking drunk a far way is though with cops out
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	We don't want to be far away
+13364068233	Jun 7, 2014, 4:19 PM	No	That sounds sick though
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 4:19 PM	Yes	The cops aren't looking to arrest you, and obviously, but it will be way more comfortable 
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 4:21 PM	No	I agree
+13364086079	Jun 7, 2014, 4:23 PM	No	Yeah that sounds awesome 
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	
+13364036025	Jun 7, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:25 PM	No	Plus it isn't next door to the woman's house
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 4:25 PM	No	
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:25 PM	No	I'm checking to make sure it's the same week
+13364036025	Jun 7, 2014, 4:25 PM	No	This sounds better and better depending how close it is
+13364068233	Jun 7, 2014, 4:25 PM	No	Sweet
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 4:25 PM	No	I vote new house
+13368314649	Jun 7, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	Yes
+13364086079	Jun 7, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	Hell yes 
+13364068233	Jun 7, 2014, 4:27 PM	No	Yes
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:28 PM	No	Dude the tv will be clutch, World Cup, Stanley cup, Nba finals, x games are all during beach week
+13368132145	Jun 7, 2014, 4:32 PM	No	Mmmmm  World Cup 
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:46 PM	No	Heck yeah, it's only 5 blocks from our old house. Emphasis on our OLD HOUSE because I told her we wanted the upgrade
+17046570257	Jun 7, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	Is it 5 blocks further from the other houses? It closer 
+17046570257	Jun 7, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	Or*
+13364036025	Jun 7, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	How far is it from other people? Like other houses?
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:49 PM	No	We weren't five blocks away from the other houses initially but it's probably that much farther
+17046570257	Jun 7, 2014, 4:50 PM	No	So twice the distance 
+17046570257	Jun 7, 2014, 4:50 PM	No	So the amount we have to walk to get to the other houses will take twice as long 
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:50 PM	No	What kind of math is that?
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 4:51 PM	No	I was wondering that
+17046570257	Jun 7, 2014, 4:51 PM	No	Yeah so what's the deal 
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:52 PM	No	I actually don't know but relax
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 4:52 PM	No	Yeah, we just scored an awesome new house, let's be happy about it
+17046570257	Jun 7, 2014, 4:53 PM	No	I just don't wanna have to do cardio to get to the other houses 
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:53 PM	No	It's a really small distance anyways so it doesn't matter  
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	Who is excited for our new house? Wooooo
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 4:54 PM	Yes	I am
+17046570257	Jun 7, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	I wanna know a distance 
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:55 PM	No	10 blocks max
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 4:55 PM	Yes	It doesn't really matter, if I have to walk ten blocks and I know it, or I have to walk ten blocks and I don't know how far it is, I still walk 10 blocks
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	I'm excited! 
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	Thank you Connor

+13364036025	Jun 7, 2014, 5:01 PM	No	Well let us know when you know it so we can just figure out how far away it is from us right now and stuff like that so we can get to it loo
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	Not an address
+13364086079	Jun 7, 2014, 5:03 PM	No	Don't think that's the address 
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 5:03 PM	No	On closer inspection, it's not the address 
+13364068233	Jun 7, 2014, 5:14 PM	No	Thank you Professor Robinson 
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 5:34 PM	No	Indubitably

+13364068233	Jun 7, 2014, 5:56 PM	No	Thanks jay
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 5:57 PM	No	Heads up, I heard a story where one year people got arrested when they were unloading the beer out of their cars and got ambushed
+13364068233	Jun 7, 2014, 5:59 PM	No	Yea that happened to some guy Cameron who graduated two years go
+17344782101	Jun 7, 2014, 6:00 PM	Yes	Let's not unload the second we get there then
+13364068233	Jun 7, 2014, 6:18 PM	No	Good idea
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 6:20 PM	No	I can't believe it's on Saturday 
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	Can this be added to the rule book?
+13368314649	Jun 7, 2014, 7:14 PM	No	Never unload. Tailgate for dYs
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 7:51 PM	No	
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 7:56 PM	No	Trust me I'm an engineer
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	I'm worried about Robbie for a myriad of reasons
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 8:55 PM	No	Way to pull out you learning library vocab for that one
+13368314649	Jun 7, 2014, 8:56 PM	No	Is myriad a noun or adj?
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	It's both
+13368314649	Jun 7, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	"""A myriad"" or ""myriad reasons"""
+13368165198	Jun 7, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	Tamara taught it incorrectly
+14235983552	Jun 7, 2014, 9:19 PM	No	Mhmm
+13368165198	Jun 8, 2014, 4:04 PM	No	Have we considered getting a keg? My dad said that was what he did for beach week, it's 15 gallons of beer
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 4:07 PM	Yes	It's not a bad idea, but aside from acquiring it, portability might be an issue
+14235983552	Jun 8, 2014, 4:08 PM	No	I'm with Connor, if we can get one though, it probably a good idea
+13368165198	Jun 8, 2014, 4:21 PM	No	It's equates to about 50 per beer
+14235983552	Jun 8, 2014, 4:35 PM	No	It's a good deal
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	"Can I draw the attention to the fact that you just answered a yes or no question with ""both"". For obvious reasons I don't give a fuck, But the keg seems like a good idea to keep people from fucking up. Everyone can see when people get alcohol, so we can know how much everyone is having. Also, no one is going to get caught with that beer on them without puss ing off a lot of people."
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 6:23 PM	No	Pissing
+13368165198	Jun 8, 2014, 8:59 PM	No	"Man I'd be super ""pussed"", that's what you say when a girl is really mad"
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 9:03 PM	No	Haha
+17046570257	Jun 8, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	So keg or no keg 
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 9:13 PM	Yes	I think the real question is 4 kegs or 8
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 9:14 PM	Yes	One keg is less than a gallon and a half for the week per son, noble drinks more milk than that in a day so clearly it won't be enough
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 9:15 PM	Yes	Per person*
+17344782101	Jun 8, 2014, 9:15 PM	Yes	Because milk = beer
+13368165198	Jun 8, 2014, 9:20 PM	No	Not everyone would use it
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	(No beer for me)
+13368165198	Jun 8, 2014, 9:22 PM	No	Or me
+13364036025	Jun 8, 2014, 9:23 PM	No	I don't drink
+13368165198	Jun 8, 2014, 9:56 PM	No	Funny
+13364068233	Jun 8, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	No one told me we were drinking this trip?
+13364068233	Jun 8, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	That's it I'm out
+13368165198	Jun 8, 2014, 9:57 PM	No	These jokes aren't funny
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 9:58 PM	No	I'm actually serious though. I really hate beer, and I have my own liquor.
+13368165198	Jun 8, 2014, 9:58 PM	No	Wow Brian. Beating a dead horse
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 9:58 PM	No	I think they are
+13368314649	Jun 8, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	Just trying to make sure... I gratuitously apologize

+13368165198	Jun 8, 2014, 10:27 PM	No	You should teach them

+13368165198	Jun 11, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	That's what I was thinking
+14235983552	Jun 11, 2014, 7:38 PM	No	That's actually a better idea

+13368165198	Jun 21, 2014, 12:26 PM	No	Kissing pictures make people uncomfortable
+13368165198	Jun 21, 2014, 12:27 PM	No	Should you be texting while flying a plane?
+13368314649	Jun 21, 2014, 12:31 PM	No	Also, the caption puts into question her enjoyment of this experience.
+14235983552	Jun 21, 2014, 12:32 PM	No	I'm sure mount knows what he's doing

+13368314649	Jun 26, 2014, 1:17 AM	No	It will be easy as hell for you. I've done it before but I have four projects active right now so I'd like to outsource a bit. Go to Reynoldagreen.com and roll over one of the tie images. It will probably take you less than an hour and a half. I need so.ething like that and I know js is fresh in your mind.
+17344782101	Jun 26, 2014, 1:21 AM	Yes	I'm not sure I understand exactly what you mean, can you email me specifics at crmounts@gmail.com, I'll take a look at it for you in the morning 
+13368314649	Jun 26, 2014, 1:22 AM	No	Okay thanks. I'll chalk it out.

+19896009631	Jun 9, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	should be about 5-6 hours 
+17344782101	Jun 9, 2014, 7:24 PM	Yes	Not terrible, have you been able to get a wharton email yet?
+19896009631	Jun 9, 2014, 7:28 PM	No	Yeah it's not awful. And no, I think they said we would be able to starting the 10th 
+19896009631	Jun 12, 2014, 12:38 PM	No	Hey I'm not flaking on the tickets, I'm just waiting for my dad to come home because my mom's never wired money in the US and doesn't know how so
+17344782101	Jun 12, 2014, 3:14 PM	Yes	It's fine, I didn't think you were, if it's easier for you to have me get the tickets though I can, also on a different note do you have a notice from penn saying you have a payment due the 17th but have no bills in penn pay? 
+19896009631	Jun 12, 2014, 3:15 PM	No	I haven't gotten that yet but I haven't checked today.. On PennIntouch it said I had some payments and stuff but I didn't find anything
+17344782101	Jun 12, 2014, 3:31 PM	Yes	Yeah that's what I'm talking about, payments due on bills that don't seem to exist, not sure what to do
+19896009631	Jun 12, 2014, 3:31 PM	No	I'd just lay back to be honest, if you can't did anything. Or email your advisor or admissions office?
+17344782101	Jun 12, 2014, 3:33 PM	Yes	Thats probably what I'll do, just wanted to see if I was the only one having this problem, anyway how's your summer going?
+19896009631	Jun 12, 2014, 3:37 PM	No	Pretty solid! I'm just bumming it, how's yours?
+17344782101	Jun 12, 2014, 3:42 PM	Yes	Pretty good, and same, about to head down to the beach for nc senior week though, so barring an arrest that should be pretty sweet, any big trips/plans this summer?
+19896009631	Jun 12, 2014, 3:42 PM	No	Stay safe man, that's sick you guys have senior week! And nah, nothing planned because of the family's move to Chicago
+17344782101	Jun 12, 2014, 3:45 PM	Yes	Yeah, it's pretty nice, if you don't mind my asking, what's bringing your family to Chicago?
+19896009631	Jun 12, 2014, 3:45 PM	No	My dad got a job with Honeywell and that's their hq 
+17344782101	Jun 12, 2014, 3:54 PM	Yes	Cool, how long have y'all lived in MI?
+19896009631	Jun 12, 2014, 4:58 PM	No	8 years now! You used to live here didn't you?
+17344782101	Jun 12, 2014, 7:05 PM	Yes	Ann Arbor, moved four years ago, where were you before that?
+19896009631	Jun 12, 2014, 9:53 PM	No	We moved from Brazil 
+19896009631	Jun 13, 2014, 5:42 PM	No	Hey, so my parents are being weird about buying the tickets together
+17344782101	Jun 13, 2014, 5:43 PM	Yes	That's fine, would you rather have me get both, or just buy them separate? And very cool, do you speak Portuguese?
+19896009631	Jun 13, 2014, 5:44 PM	No	I don't mind, I can just place the order for mine right now
+19896009631	Jun 13, 2014, 5:44 PM	No	And yeah I do!
+19896009631	Jun 13, 2014, 5:45 PM	No	Oh, and happy birthday man! 
+19896009631	Jun 13, 2014, 5:55 PM	No	The main reason why is for mailing tickets I think, idk. But if we are doing this separate at least use same venue?
+17344782101	Jun 13, 2014, 6:14 PM	Yes	Thanks! And I don't think it really matters cause the whole thing is ga, we should be fine, do you speak Spanish as well?
+19896009631	Jun 13, 2014, 6:17 PM	No	Ok then, sweet. I just bought mine. And I don't speak it really but I can get around and hold a conversation pretty well. Just sometimes I have to ask the native to slow down or find a synonym 
+19896009631	Jun 17, 2014, 1:45 PM	No	"Hey, how do you want to coordinate the room? I have a 37"" TV I could bring, that may be a little big for the dorm"
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 2:07 PM	Yes	TVs up to you, not entirely sure that we need one, but I guess having it wouldn't hurt. We definitely need a fridge and probably a microwave, a printer probably wouldn't hurt either, I have one of those I could bring, and we can divvy the rest however you want, and I definitely want to try to pick up portugese this year, also I apologize if my texts become incoherent, beach week is going fantastically
+19896009631	Jun 17, 2014, 2:08 PM	No	Hahaha dude no stress, those end up being entertaining! And yeah I agree with the three things. Do you think buying them at a department store there would be easier? You know what, we can discuss this later I forgot you had beach week. Cheers!
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 2:22 PM	Yes	I think I'm actually buying everything, sheets etc. in Pennsylvania because my parents don't want to drive, so it won't be to difficult to pick stuff up. And sounds good man, talk to you in a couple days
+19896009631	Jun 30, 2014, 7:14 PM	No	Do you know if it costs to camp? Oh and I met this dude on my mission trip that's from Chicago so if we wanna party he said he's our guy 
+19896009631	Jun 30, 2014, 7:14 PM	No	At lolla*
+17344782101	Jun 30, 2014, 7:40 PM	Yes	Awesome, and unfortunately I have no idea, I checked the site and there doesn't seem to be anything about camping on there at all
+19896009631	Jun 30, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	Yeah that's why I asked I couldn't find it
+17344782101	Jul 1, 2014, 8:49 AM	Yes	I'll try to find someone who's been and ask, where'd you go on your mission trip?
+19896009631	Jul 1, 2014, 11:27 AM	No	Alright, and Kentucky 
+17344782101	Jul 1, 2014, 11:44 AM	Yes	What's in Kentucky?
+19896009631	Jul 1, 2014, 11:45 AM	No	Maysville, a smal town with some houses to repair 
+19896009631	Jul 7, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	Hey man, just running this by you, but there's probably gonna be some more people crashing at my house so they save up on hotels, that's chill by you right
+17344782101	Jul 7, 2014, 3:03 PM	Yes	Of course, they all goin to Lolla?
+19896009631	Jul 7, 2014, 3:03 PM	No	Yeah that's the plan
+17344782101	Jul 7, 2014, 3:59 PM	Yes	Look forward to meeting them then
+19896009631	Jul 7, 2014, 5:00 PM	No	I'm jacked
+19896009631	Jul 17, 2014, 1:40 PM	No	Hey man, I was wondering if we could figure out some dorm stuff soon? Mainly because my parents are riding my ass about it. So between renting or buying stuff, and what that stuff would be
+17344782101	Jul 17, 2014, 1:49 PM	Yes	Absolutely, I'd like to have a fridge, and a printer (which I can bring), what all are you thinking about and how can I best contribute?
+19896009631	Jul 17, 2014, 1:58 PM	No	I really only thought fridge, microwave and printer. And then if we had room a small TV 
+17344782101	Jul 17, 2014, 2:25 PM	Yes	That sounds good to me, would you rather rent the fridge or purchase one?
+19896009631	Jul 17, 2014, 6:37 PM	No	I don't think I have a preference 
+17344782101	Jul 17, 2014, 8:14 PM	Yes	Okay, I know you mentioned having a tv, so maybe you cover that and the microwave and I'll cover the fridge and printer? Also when's your move in slot?
+19896009631	Jul 17, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	I think it's 11-1 and yeah I think that can be a good split! 
+17344782101	Jul 17, 2014, 8:45 PM	Yes	22nd? And sweet
+19896009631	Jul 17, 2014, 8:51 PM	No	Yeah the 22nd
+19896009631	Jul 17, 2014, 8:57 PM	No	When's yours?
+17344782101	Jul 17, 2014, 9:00 PM	Yes	Same, my Lolla tickets just came in
+19896009631	Jul 17, 2014, 9:01 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jul 17, 2014, 9:22 PM	Yes	Getting very pumped. how's your class schedule looking?
+19896009631	Jul 17, 2014, 9:23 PM	No	No classes before 10:30 except Friday for an hour, so if I get it it'll be good! Try to workout in the morning though to feel more productive.. How's yours?
+17344782101	Jul 17, 2014, 10:23 PM	Yes	Nothing before 11, and very light mwf, so it be awesome if it went through as is, and I was hoping to do the same thing with my mornings, so that extra accountability will be nice, you said you were starting to lift regularly this summer, how's that been going?
+19896009631	Jul 17, 2014, 10:31 PM	No	Tat sounds solid for sure, mine is lighter mwf too. And pretty good! I'm having an impossible time trying to bulk just because I forget to eat that much, but I'm going a steady 4 days/week
+17344782101	Jul 18, 2014, 10:36 AM	Yes	That's awesome man, and I'm sure you'll figure out the bulk once you get to school, I've found that summer makes it almost impossible to have any consist eating habits
+19896009631	Jul 18, 2014, 10:44 AM	No	Yeah that's my problem too
+19896009631	Jul 21, 2014, 4:24 PM	No	Do you have any idea to the dimensions of the closet in hill? 
+17344782101	Jul 21, 2014, 4:28 PM	Yes	No, the diagram it showed me was just an ambiguous 13 x 11 square room, what do you think about the projects Malik and Cajigas are trying to start?
+19896009631	Jul 21, 2014, 4:53 PM	No	Yep. All I got too. Well last minute shopping will probably happen anyway. And it sounds pretty cool actually. I'm just not at all familiar with it and idk how life will be at first so I never messages them 
+19896009631	Jul 21, 2014, 4:53 PM	No	What about you
+17344782101	Jul 21, 2014, 5:03 PM	Yes	Haha most of my shopping is probably going to get done the week/day before, I'm a terrible procrastinator. And they are both definitely topics of interest, but I need to get to know them a little better, even with my limited knowledge base I can see that their is quite a few gaps in theirs, and I need to get a sense of where they think they are and how they are going to structure and manage their respective organizations
+19896009631	Jul 21, 2014, 5:05 PM	No	Yeah I feel you on that. It's hard to just dive into something like that without knowledge of really anything. \LF\LFAlso, do you have a drying rack thing or is that one of the procrastinated items? What we could do right after we move in is figure out what's missing and check the move in store too. 
+17344782101	Jul 21, 2014, 5:38 PM	Yes	Haha yes it is, and I do not, and yeah I'm down to do the check what's missing and work from there method
+19896009631	Jul 21, 2014, 5:41 PM	No	Alright sweet
+19896009631	Jul 26, 2014, 5:52 PM	No	Hey I know we talked about fridge and microwave split. Would you want to rent and then split the price instead of buying them and bringing them?
+17344782101	Jul 27, 2014, 12:33 AM	Yes	That's fine with me, I get back to the states tonight and can put the order in then, looks like it will be 100 a piece
+19896009631	Jul 27, 2014, 12:33 AM	No	Oh you're out of the country? I didn't even know. Last text i promise my bad. 
+17344782101	Jul 27, 2014, 12:35 AM	Yes	Haha it's fine, and yeah I've been in Greece/Bulgaria for about a week
+19896009631	Jul 27, 2014, 7:44 PM	No	Hey I know we talked about fridge and microwave split. Would you want to rent and then split the price instead of buying them and bringing them?
+19896009631	Jul 24, 2014, 8:13 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jul 27, 2014, 7:47 PM	Yes	Nice, got to go pick mine up from the post office tomorrow
+17344782101	Jul 29, 2014, 6:06 PM	Yes	How are we coordinating Friday?
+19896009631	Jul 29, 2014, 6:13 PM	No	No clue. I'm driving down Thursday. If you want to come then or early Friday idc. I have to drop my dad did at the airport early on Friday so if you're flying in early I could pick you up? Umm or just drive to my house or meet at the concert. 
+17344782101	Jul 29, 2014, 6:20 PM	Yes	I fly in the middle of the day Friday I think, I'll have to double check the time but I guess I'll just see where your at when I get there and go there?
+19896009631	Jul 29, 2014, 6:21 PM	No	Middle of the day? Alright. I'll probably be at the concert if it's late middle honestly
+17344782101	Jul 29, 2014, 6:28 PM	Yes	Actually I land at 10:40
+19896009631	Jul 29, 2014, 6:32 PM	No	Oh dude that's no problem maybe I'll be around the city or something. You fly into O'Hare?
+17344782101	Jul 29, 2014, 6:45 PM	Yes	I do, if I end up getting in on time, what would work best for you?
+19896009631	Jul 29, 2014, 6:47 PM	No	To be honest I have no clue. I probably won't have my car in the city.. I'm hoping the train will be working. 
+17344782101	Jul 29, 2014, 7:10 PM	Yes	Haha alright, I guess well figure it out Friday then, my moms coming in to visit some family so I will have a rental car if we need it, but I don't want to keep her too long
+19896009631	Jul 29, 2014, 7:12 PM	No	Alright man, I'll keep it in mind. The only thing would be your luggage, right? Or else we could just meet at some coffee shop or something close to the airport
+17344782101	Jul 29, 2014, 8:26 PM	Yes	Yeah, I'm actually staying in Illinois a week so ima have a little bit, how far is your house from the airport?
+19896009631	Jul 29, 2014, 8:25 PM	No	I think about 40 minutes
+17344782101	Jul 29, 2014, 8:53 PM	Yes	Alright, if there's some way for me to get in I could swing by and drop my stuff off and then meet you somewhere near Lolla?
+19896009631	Jul 29, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	Yeah for sure and maybe I could wait for you at my house
+17344782101	Jul 29, 2014, 10:12 PM	Yes	Whatever works best for you is fine for me
+19896009631	Jul 29, 2014, 10:13 PM	No	Alright I'll see if I can just chill at home then we can catch the train into the city. I don't think the morning line up on Friday is that great 
+17344782101	Jul 29, 2014, 10:28 PM	Yes	Sounds good
+17344782101	Jul 30, 2014, 2:47 PM	Yes	Hey could I get your Chicago address?

+17344782101	Aug 14, 2014, 12:40 PM	Yes	I don't think so, I just got the package that came with that fridge rental site they emailed us about
+19896009631	Aug 14, 2014, 12:40 PM	No	Alright that's chill
+17344782101	Aug 14, 2014, 12:42 PM	Yes	Do you think we need one? Also how goes moving into the new house?

+17344782101	Aug 14, 2014, 1:12 PM	Yes	Fair enough
+19896009631	Aug 14, 2014, 2:20 PM	No	I say we get some sort of coffee maker when were there too
+17344782101	Aug 14, 2014, 3:06 PM	Yes	Alright, works for me, but I think they might have them in the lounge areas already
+19896009631	Aug 14, 2014, 3:07 PM	No	Good call. We'll worry about it in a week then
+17344782101	Aug 14, 2014, 7:08 PM	Yes	It's gonna be a long week 
+19896009631	Aug 14, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	This one? Time's flying dude... By the way, how was visiting your grandma?
+17344782101	Aug 14, 2014, 7:40 PM	Yes	Haha my gym membership expires tomorrow and I have nothing else to do, and it was alright, she was doing really well the first day but it was downhill from there
+19896009631	Aug 14, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	Sorry to hear that. And hey, I haven't had a gym for two weeks now so I know the feeling
+19896009631	Aug 15, 2014, 9:51 AM	No	Hey, our GA ( Michael J Ernst ) ask me to ask you to friend him and join the Hill Blue Shote Group. You should've gotten an email with the request to join 
+17344782101	Aug 15, 2014, 1:11 PM	Yes	I'll do that, but I never got the request, so I'm not sure I'll be able to find the group if it's private 
+19896009631	Aug 15, 2014, 1:38 PM	No	Just chat him or something, he seems nice 
+17344782101	Aug 15, 2014, 1:43 PM	Yes	Alright
+17344782101	Aug 18, 2014, 7:45 PM	Yes	My parents were wondering if you and your parents wanted to get dinner Thursday?
+19896009631	Aug 18, 2014, 7:47 PM	No	Umm my it'll be just me and my dad, I'm sure he'd be interested. He's in a meeting I'll ask him when he's out
+17344782101	Aug 18, 2014, 7:52 PM	Yes	Alright, just let me know, reservations at 815 at a restaurant called pod
+19896009631	Aug 18, 2014, 8:21 PM	No	Yeah my dad loved the idea. He just asked me to ask for your parents names 
+17344782101	Aug 18, 2014, 8:29 PM	Yes	Sweet, and David and Mary, could I get your dad's name?
+19896009631	Aug 18, 2014, 8:33 PM	No	Fernando 
+17344782101	Aug 20, 2014, 6:01 PM	Yes	Hey does the tv your bringing have an hdmi port?
+19896009631	Aug 20, 2014, 6:04 PM	No	I'm not gonna bring one because I wanna see the room first. So if we end up having the room I was probably gonna buy one there. If there's not then I can chip in more cash toward the fridge/micro since you're bringing a printer. Or the rug or idk
+17344782101	Aug 20, 2014, 8:21 PM	Yes	Alright, I was actually doing the same thing with the printer so that's fine
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 1:28 PM	Yes	Do you have a water filter already or should I pick one up?
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 1:29 PM	No	Pick one up if you can
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 1:29 PM	No	We can go shopping together for the stuff we find out we're missing tomorrow too. I'll pick up a drying rack today if you don't have one though
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 1:31 PM	Yes	Sounds good
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 3:04 PM	Yes	Our room looks like a prison cell
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 3:17 PM	No	Seriously
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 3:20 PM	No	How'd you see it
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 3:23 PM	Yes	I just showed up and asked to move in early, and yeah, bars on the windows, closets are pretty big though so that's nice
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 3:31 PM	No	Oh okay nice on the closets! And oh damn, maybe I'll see if I can at least see the room today
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 3:47 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 3:47 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 3:48 PM	Yes	You could probably move in, not at all crowded
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 3:52 PM	No	Alright I'm at walmart I'll see 
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 4:14 PM	Yes	Please do I'm lonely
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 4:46 PM	No	Hahaha I'm sure it's a blast. Did you already get your id and stuff too
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 4:51 PM	Yes	Haha ehh, I didn't really stick around long enough to meet anyone, and yeah
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 4:58 PM	No	Do they only allow move ins until 8? 
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 5:02 PM	Yes	Once you check in and get your id and key you can move in whenever I think, people only help till 4 though, but I could probably come help carry shit if you need it
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	Shit yeah if I manage to make it tonight my car is packed
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 5:05 PM	Yes	Alright, I'll be out at target for a bit, but just let me know, I'll try to get back

+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 6:02 PM	No	Can't find a single number to call. Did you go to the Hill front desk or what
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 6:04 PM	Yes	There should be a tent right outside hill where you can pick up keys and guest passes
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 6:04 PM	No	Good enough to convince my dad off of
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 6:04 PM	No	I'm gonna try and head there right now
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 6:05 PM	Yes	Alright, almost done at target
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 6:06 PM	No	Or as soon as my phone has decent battery
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 8:17 PM	Yes	Y'all almost here?
+19896009631	Aug 21, 2014, 8:17 PM	No	Yeah, a couple minutes walking
+17344782101	Aug 21, 2014, 8:20 PM	Yes	Alright, we're already at the table, it's toward the back of the room
+19896009631	Aug 22, 2014, 8:52 AM	No	My dad wants to go to the 1:30 parents meeting so he wants to go shopping today. I'll send pics of lamp and rug? Any poster I see I'll send too, but we can get more of them later if we get a cab or something

+17344782101	Aug 22, 2014, 9:30 AM	Yes	Two things, pick up some 2 maybe even 3 ply tp, and you and your dad are welcome to come to brunch if you want
+19896009631	Aug 22, 2014, 9:32 AM	No	Got it. And we wanna get this shopping out of the way and be back around since we have a mandatory floor meeting at 430 
+17344782101	Aug 22, 2014, 9:34 AM	Yes	Okay, I'll introduce you to Christine later then
+19896009631	Aug 22, 2014, 9:34 AM	No	Ok sounds good. Thank you for the invite though

+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 11:51 AM	Yes	Just got this, appreciate the heads and hope you had a great night
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 12:06 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 12:37 PM	Yes	I'm glad to hear it, and yes, it's not very often that I meet pretty girls who like math and know what actuarial science is, it was nice, if you want to get together sometime later this week let me know, if not, good luck at UVA
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 12:48 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 2:19 PM	Yes	Yay nerds, if this is your last night I think we might need to be a little more proactive than maybe, we're having people tonight, 303 rice circle, your welcome to come, and bring friends, preferably not guys though
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 2:46 PM	No	Okay I will talk to my friends and let you know! That's awesome though thanks for the invite! What theme are y'all doing tonight?
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 3:00 PM	Yes	Sounds good, no theme, just having a good time. For the record, I would really like for you to come
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 3:18 PM	No	
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 3:18 PM	No	Like your house
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 9:45 PM	Yes	So we decided to just go out and not have people, let me know if you still want to meet up
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 9:46 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 9:49 PM	Yes	You've got a bright future so I understand why you wouldn't want to take a risk, but if you do decide to come out were just walking on the beach and could meet you by the pier, no cops, quite peaceful actually
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Is there a group of you? 
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 9:52 PM	Yes	Right now it's just me and friend, I'm with a group, but they seem to have dissapeared

+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 10:17 PM	Yes	Yes, and to be honest it's making it rather difficult to interpret your emojiis
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 10:20 PM	Yes	By the way I promise I can still maintain sophisticated conversation, I know that's rarely enticing to girls, but I think for you it might have a certain appeal
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 10:20 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 10:31 PM	Yes	It's less of a positive than you might think, anyways the cops can only ruin this night as much as you let them, say the word and I'll meet you at the beach
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 10:48 PM	No	
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 11:00 PM	Yes	It's your last night, and you aren't a mom, of course I respect that you take care of your friends, if you want let me know when your done and we can meet up
+17344782101	Jun 17, 2014, 11:27 PM	Yes	I just realized that was a lot more aggressive then intended, sorry about that
+18042183439	Jun 17, 2014, 11:26 PM	No	I think I'm going to stay in tonight I'm really sorry I just saw 13 people get arrested... I really wish that I could've seen you tonight and no not at all you're fine!  
+17344782101	Jun 18, 2014, 12:06 AM	Yes	I'm sorry, well if you change your mind I'm stumbling around the beach

+13367451259	Jul 29, 2014, 10:08 PM	No	I want my brothers and see this video, and if only the first 20 minutes of it is fine, because this will emphasize the real foundation of hard work. It doesn't matter what you do, and we might not become body builders, but it's the mentality that real success requires. I know we struggle with internal discipline sometimes, but we all have it in us to accomplish our dreams. It's all up to us to define our future, and it will not be given to you. YOU have to reach down deep and really challenge yourself with the basic life habits that will lead to the destination that you aspire to. Don't be fooled by complacency or laziness, it's all about how much real work you put into what you love. Regardless of what that is, the work ethic and discipline stays the same. Love you all. \LF\LFCheck out this video on YouTube:\LF\LFhttp://youtu.be/OyICPcBKEDk

+17758154378	Aug 17, 2014, 1:39 PM	No	"The burger patty, though purported to be ""medium,"" had approximately the same consistency and gastronomic appeal as the sole of one of my Cole Haan driving loafers. The egg, cooked over easy, arrived running down the sides of the patty and had soaked through the bun to the point that the once ostensibly crispy faux-brioche had taken on the texture of a baguette that had been floating for several days in a puddle on a busy city street. The bacon, if if may be called that, tasted as though it had been packed in salt for shipment by 18th century sailboat, and that the chef had unwittingly placed it straight onto the burger without even having afforded me the decency of first rinsing it off. Bizarrely enough, it was also shredded in a fashion that unfortunately made it seem more similar to blighted pulled pork than to bacon. The ambience of the restaurant, evidently a gauche attempt at a trendy modern chic, was sabotaged quite enthusiastically  by the 80s soft core pornography soundtrack that passed as background music, as well as by the enormous brown water stains which had taken over the ceiling. \LF0/5 stars, would not recommend even to my worst enemy.

+13365281127	Aug 11, 2014, 1:18 PM	No	Hey Connor it's Luke Hutcherson. Could you tell me a little about AP Bio
+17344782101	Aug 11, 2014, 2:47 PM	Yes	I think that the workload depends somewhat on the teacher, so if it's still Clifton it generally won't be terrible. That being said the difficulty can get up there at times and there is a lot of material so some nights will be loaded (meaning full chapter in a night, average being 2 - 3 nights to read a chapter) and suck. On the whole though it is manageable and the general sentiment in the class was that as long as you read both the text and the summary book atleast once (1 - 4 hours work depending on chapter length and difficulty) for each chapter you'd be well prepared for tests. Lastly, unless it's not Clifton or he's changed his approach don't expect to cover much of anything in class, and the ap exam was generally considered easier than we had all anticipated. Anything else?
+13365281127	Aug 11, 2014, 2:52 PM	No	Thank you so much man I really appreciate that! On average how many hours a night did you work? Do you still have your notes?
+17344782101	Aug 11, 2014, 3:03 PM	Yes	No problem, and first semester 45 minutes to an hour when I was feeling it, second semester usually not so much if any at all, and I do not, but the summary book is really good, also a couple of times the test was just the questions from the summary book so it's usually a good idea to do those
+17344782101	Aug 11, 2014, 3:04 PM	Yes	By the way on the time thing it really fluctuated, there was really no consistency with assignments in terms of length and difficulty
+13365281127	Aug 11, 2014, 3:10 PM	No	Thank yog so much man this has really helped. Have fun at college. 
+17344782101	Aug 11, 2014, 3:18 PM	Yes	No problem, will do, have a great senior year
+13365281127	Aug 11, 2014, 3:20 PM	No	Thank you. Will do
+13365281127	Aug 13, 2014, 9:05 AM	No	Do you have your ap bio text book. Just was told to read five chapters by Monday
+17344782101	Aug 13, 2014, 9:25 AM	Yes	Unfortunately I think we might have handed it off already, also if it's the first five chapters and you feel like you already know it you can probably get away with the summary book, it's all review from other courses
+13365281127	Aug 13, 2014, 9:26 AM	No	Shit. Do you get the summary book from the fury
+17344782101	Aug 13, 2014, 9:50 AM	Yes	Yeah
+13365281127	Aug 13, 2014, 3:58 PM	No	Is the summary book the college board ap exam prep thing? 
+17344782101	Aug 13, 2014, 4:04 PM	Yes	Can't remember, should be on the book list
+13365281127	Aug 13, 2014, 4:03 PM	No	What did you do during class?
+17344782101	Aug 13, 2014, 4:07 PM	Yes	We never really did anything in class
+13365281127	Aug 13, 2014, 4:07 PM	No	Does he say like read? Or does he ever quiz you on the reading
+17344782101	Aug 13, 2014, 4:08 PM	Yes	Yeah he usually said to read, and not really
+13365281127	Aug 13, 2014, 4:35 PM	No	What do you do with the book how to build a dinosaur....
+17344782101	Aug 13, 2014, 4:37 PM	Yes	We didn't have that one

+13477568573	Sep 12, 2014, 5:39 PM	No	Vanessa just left me a voicemail about some other website where they have their ow. Warehouse and they do the shipping for you and you just put your logo on their products. She said you won't make as much money that way but she might want to do that because she doesn't want to ship anything herself. She also said to look into how the templates we showed her today worked but she likes the idea of this warehouse website. I don't know if we create our own website with this source or how it works but I'll play the voicemail she left for all of you. Can we all meet either tomorrow or Sunday to work/discuss?? 
+13016412364	Sep 12, 2014, 7:03 PM	No	Yeah Sunday would be great
+19143747730	Sep 12, 2014, 7:05 PM	No	yeah sunday does sound great but i think shes okay with shipping the stuff herself for now...she said she might consider the warehouse idea if this project is successful, no?
+13477568573	Sep 12, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	she left me a voicemail i will play it for you all when we meet. she doesnt want to ship it herself
+19739705320	Sep 12, 2014, 7:19 PM	No	Sunday is good

+13477568573	Sep 12, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	I think this is what she meant in the voicemail when she said she might want to use a website that creates the clothes/items for her so she can sell them through the website so she wont have to deal with shipping... http://www.spreadshirt.com check out this website under the sell part. Ill play the voicemail for you all on Sunday but I think this is what she meant..

+13477568573	Sep 13, 2014, 12:25 PM	No	I just got another voicemail followed by an email but this time from Debbie. I forwarded it to all of you. We should discuss what she wrote and I will play the voicemails for you tomorrow. As of now though, she said not to bother with trial runs of the templates we showed them. She said she's so amazed by the effort we already put into the project but they didn't realize until our meeting with Vanessa that running the online store themselves would be this difficult. What time can everyone meet tomorrow? 
+13016412364	Sep 13, 2014, 12:32 PM	No	My parents were thinking about coming in around 4 tomorrow so I'm free anytime before then. Does maybe 1 work?

Www.surveymonkey.com/s/PD7T9TT \LF\LFLet me know if I should change anything on the survey. I made it short so people will actually do it. We can post in on Facebook and email it later and ask Vanessa to post it in the Bianca's kids Facebook page 
+16174489740	Sep 22, 2014, 7:43 PM	No	How's everything going with the case and the LOE?
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 7:46 PM	No	We are finishing the case study now. After we incorporated your edits we were almost 100 words over the limit so we are cutting it down. We should be finished soon though.

+17344782101	Sep 24, 2014, 12:54 PM	Yes	Can we make a group calendar, and have everyone just post their schedule to it? It might be a little bit of effort but we'll never have this issue again

+13016412364	Sep 24, 2014, 12:57 PM	No	There's a website called when2meet. U can just fill out when your classes are other commitments are and then the website will automatically tell us when everyone's free!
+13016412364	Sep 24, 2014, 12:57 PM	No	I can make it and post it in a little bit
+17344782101	Sep 24, 2014, 12:59 PM	Yes	That isn't reusable though
+17344782101	Sep 24, 2014, 1:00 PM	Yes	Honestly the Google calendar is the best at to go long term, literally just sink it to your own and it will update automatically when you change your own calendar
+13477568573	Sep 25, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	Hi we need to do the weekly work plan. Since all of our schedules are super busy/different maybe each committee should meet sometime this weekend and plan their goals per week since it would be easier for us to figure out a time with only a couple of people. Then we can meet maybe sunday or monday night as a whole team and go over it. Thoughts?
+19143747730	Sep 25, 2014, 5:29 PM	No	I can't Sunday night my family is coming into town but yeah that sounds good 
+19739705320	Sep 25, 2014, 5:35 PM	No	That's fine with me. Either night works 
+13016412364	Sep 26, 2014, 12:50 PM	No	Are we meeting in van pelt today?
+13477568573	Sep 26, 2014, 12:51 PM	No	Yea 
+13477568573	Sep 26, 2014, 12:51 PM	No	That's what the syllabus says
+16174489740	Sep 26, 2014, 1:36 PM	No	Yes! Let's meet outside of van pelt by the button at 255
+13477568573	Sep 27, 2014, 9:34 AM	No	Hi whenever the LOE group is 100% done with edits could you email it to me so I can send it to the client? 
+13477568573	Sep 27, 2014, 1:53 PM	No	
+19145254270	Sep 27, 2014, 1:53 PM	No	Awesome 
+19143747730	Sep 27, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	hows the LOE coming?
+19739705320	Sep 27, 2014, 1:59 PM	No	I edit it last night and emailed it to everyone. If anyone wants me to change anything you can just let me know and I'll fix it
+19143747730	Sep 27, 2014, 1:59 PM	No	alright sounds gooodddd
+12022468481	Sep 27, 2014, 1:59 PM	No	I put some edits in last night as well 
+19143747730	Sep 27, 2014, 1:59 PM	No	
+13477568573	Sep 27, 2014, 2:03 PM	No	Ok perfect! I'll plan on emailing it tonight. If everyone can look at it at some point today and ok it I will email it tonight around 8pm
+13477568573	Sep 27, 2014, 5:28 PM	No	I was just looking over the letter of engagement and it looks great! The only problem is the assignment says it should be 500 words and ours is 753. What should we consider cutting out? Also, should I attach this document to an email or should I make this the body of the email?
+13477568573	Sep 27, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	Should we try to edit down the number of words? I didn't email it yet just waiting for the ok from all of you. I can email it tomorrow if everyone hasn't had a chance to check it yet. Let me know. 
+12022468481	Sep 27, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	I would tell you but I honestly don't know how strict these word limits are 
+19143747730	Sep 27, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	We don't need to
+19143747730	Sep 27, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	I don't think we need to 
+19143747730	Sep 27, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	Sorry I'm like not in the right mindset for this right now 
+19143747730	Sep 27, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	But if were talking about the case study I think we're fine 
+16174489740	Sep 27, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	Yeah it really should be 550 or less
+13477568573	Sep 27, 2014, 9:44 PM	No	Ok I'll email it tomorrow then and can we all try to look at it tonight or tomorrow morning and cut it down? 
+13477568573	Sep 28, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	Hi I just emailed a new version of the LOE to all of you. I got it down to 550 words. Let me know what you think 
+17344782101	Sep 28, 2014, 1:47 PM	Yes	Could you resend? Didn't get it

+13477568573	Sep 28, 2014, 1:46 PM	No	Yea I just resent it. 
+13477568573	Sep 28, 2014, 1:48 PM	No	Oh sorry! Let me know what you think. We can combine the two maybe? 
+13016412364	Sep 28, 2014, 2:00 PM	No	Sure, ill just add in a couple of small edits I made and send it back. I think it looks great though!
+13477568573	Sep 28, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	Kk perfect. Make sure it's 550 or under 
+19739705320	Sep 28, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	There are some minor typos that I saw when I looked at it just now. There were semicolons that should be commas and apostrophe s that should just be an s. Can you just make sure you change them in your edits Avikar 
+13016412364	Sep 28, 2014, 2:02 PM	No	Yeah ill look for those 
+13477568573	Sep 28, 2014, 2:02 PM	No	Woops sorry..!
+19739705320	Sep 28, 2014, 2:03 PM	No	Ok and no big deal Georgia! Thanks guys

+19739705320	Sep 28, 2014, 2:18 PM	No	In the 5th line, change man to many, but everything else looks great!
+13477568573	Sep 28, 2014, 2:18 PM	No	Looks great! there was just one typo but I fixed it
+13477568573	Sep 28, 2014, 2:18 PM	No	Are we attaching the budget plan? Can someone email that to me?
+13477568573	Sep 28, 2014, 5:49 PM	No	
+13477568573	Oct 8, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	Hi I just Vanessa an email in reply to what I previously forwarded you all. Make sure to fill out the work plan with your committees and start to work on your tasks so that we have stuff prepared for the board meeting next Friday. Is there a time we can meet Sunday or Wednesday (or both) to go over how we will conduct the board meeting and sharing our agenda? 
+19145254270	Oct 8, 2014, 7:13 PM	No	Thanks for sending that email! Sunday evening would be better for me than Wednesday 
+14438344406	Oct 8, 2014, 7:20 PM	No	Yeah, on Wednesday Adam and I will be preparing for the case report
+13477568573	Oct 9, 2014, 12:10 PM	No	Can we do Wednesday night at 8:30?

+13477568573	Oct 11, 2014, 12:02 PM	No	Hii hope you guys are having a good fall break! Can all of you email me your via character strength profiles? Naomi and I are starting to work on our status report (2nd round) and need your results to analyze. Thank you!! 
+13477568573	Oct 12, 2014, 4:15 PM	No	Did everyone fill in the time sheet for this week? Ross and Connor did you finish the work plan for the technology team? We need to post these files under team files on canvas. Is anyone by a computer who can put the google doc onto canvas?
+19143747730	Oct 12, 2014, 5:11 PM	No	I'm in a bus right now and don't have wifi...I'm so sorry 
+13477568573	Oct 12, 2014, 5:13 PM	No	Same.. 
+19143747730	Oct 12, 2014, 5:22 PM	No	I can post the workplan when I get home which is in like 30 mins
+17344782101	Oct 13, 2014, 12:18 PM	Yes	When are we meeting tonight?
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 12:50 PM	No	No one knows hahaa
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 12:51 PM	No	I think huntsman? 
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 12:51 PM	No	But I don't know which room yet
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 12:51 PM	No	also what time we we meeting? 
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 12:51 PM	No	Did we get the 8 time slot? 
+13477568573	Oct 13, 2014, 12:51 PM	No	No idea
+13477568573	Oct 13, 2014, 1:21 PM	No	Connor and Ross are you doing the work plan today???
+17344782101	Oct 13, 2014, 1:22 PM	Yes	Ross?
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 1:22 PM	No	Ross has his presentation thing
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 1:22 PM	No	Connor can you do it quickly? 
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 1:22 PM	No	It literally takes 10 mins
+14438344406	Oct 13, 2014, 1:23 PM	No	I dont have time, Im basically in class until 10 tonight, plus getting ready for the status report
+17344782101	Oct 13, 2014, 1:24 PM	Yes	I can do it tomorrow, way too much to do today
+14438344406	Oct 13, 2014, 1:26 PM	No	We can both work on it tomorrow. Our work will most likely be independent of what the work plan says anyways - both of our test results say that we do not work well with such scheduling.
+16174489740	Oct 13, 2014, 1:27 PM	No	Hi guys,\LF\LFSo sorry for the delay on this. I should have sent out last night. We are meeting at 8pm in JMHH 340
+19145254270	Oct 13, 2014, 6:15 PM	No	"Who was in charge of ""shopify"" when we did our initial research?"
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 6:29 PM	No	I might be a couple minutes late...Im at a review session for Econ in Glab until 8
+12022468481	Oct 13, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	Where is the room we are going to be in?
+12022468481	Oct 13, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	Oops nevermind
+19143747730	Oct 13, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	
+12022468481	Oct 13, 2014, 9:10 PM	No	I got it!!! 
+16174489740	Oct 14, 2014, 12:02 PM	No	Hi guys\LF\LFJust a heads up. Definitely make sure you've done the reading for today! See you all at 3
+14438344406	Oct 14, 2014, 8:27 PM	No	Can everyone email me a headshot of themselves tonight?
+14438344406	Oct 14, 2014, 8:27 PM	No	If you dont, Ill send you text messages until you do... Adam and I are working on the powerpoint
+13477568573	Oct 14, 2014, 8:32 PM	No	I just left to go to dinner with my sister can I email it to you around 10? 
+14438344406	Oct 14, 2014, 8:34 PM	No	Thats fine
+13477568573	Oct 14, 2014, 8:36 PM	No	Sorry! I'll be sure to do it the second I get home
+14438344406	Oct 14, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	It's fine
+14438344406	Oct 14, 2014, 9:40 PM	No	As long as it gets to me haha
+19145254270	Oct 15, 2014, 9:14 AM	No	Hi guys does anyone have that bundle of products, shipping containers etc that Vanessa left after our first meeting?
+19145254270	Oct 15, 2014, 9:14 AM	No	It would be helpful if I could get some pics of it 
+19143747730	Oct 15, 2014, 9:19 AM	No	I'll get you pictures of it at 12
+19145254270	Oct 15, 2014, 9:30 AM	No	Thank you so much that's perfect!
+13477568573	Oct 15, 2014, 9:30 AM	No	Good luck preparing tonight! 
+19145254270	Oct 15, 2014, 9:34 AM	No	Thank you!
+16174489740	Oct 20, 2014, 4:38 PM	No	Hi guys,\LFJust a reminder that tonight's rehearsal is at 8pm in JMHH 340
+19143747730	Oct 21, 2014, 6:56 PM	No	Ross Adam could you please send us your feedvack? 
+19143747730	Oct 21, 2014, 6:56 PM	No	Oh and Adam could you send us your headshot or put it in the shared Google folder? Thanks
+14438344406	Oct 21, 2014, 6:57 PM	No	Naomi, all I have is notecards...
+19143747730	Oct 21, 2014, 6:58 PM	No	Hmmm is there anything that came up a lot regarding both what you did well and what you could've done better?
+14438344406	Oct 21, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	The kids liked confidence. And thought our slide were cluttered. There were some small things that individuals thought we did wrong, but I kids were just making up shit and wanted to get out of there, since we were the last group
+14438344406	Oct 21, 2014, 7:02 PM	No	I think kids*
+19143747730	Oct 21, 2014, 7:47 PM	No	Hahahaha yeah I think a lot of stuff on those cards is probably made up 
+19143747730	Oct 21, 2014, 7:47 PM	No	Did you not get your score and feedback friends from dr d?
+14438344406	Oct 21, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	Nope
+19143747730	Oct 22, 2014, 11:41 PM	No	
+19143747730	Oct 22, 2014, 11:43 PM	No	Late night status report rehearsals make us crazy
+14438344406	Oct 22, 2014, 11:43 PM	No	Where's the corn?
+19143747730	Oct 22, 2014, 11:46 PM	No	Fuck 
+19143747730	Oct 22, 2014, 11:46 PM	No	
+19143747730	Oct 22, 2014, 11:46 PM	No	
+14438344406	Oct 22, 2014, 11:46 PM	No	Haha it's okay Naomi
+14438344406	Oct 22, 2014, 11:47 PM	No	
+13477568573	Oct 22, 2014, 11:48 PM	No	On our 26th hour of status report. If we mess up tomorrow were sorry. We tried. 
+12022468481	Oct 22, 2014, 11:52 PM	No	You guys will so great!
+12022468481	Oct 22, 2014, 11:52 PM	No	Do*
+14438344406	Oct 23, 2014, 12:37 AM	No	
+14438344406	Oct 23, 2014, 12:37 AM	No	All of your cards will say this^
+17344782101	Oct 23, 2014, 12:37 AM	Yes	Hey I wrote that
+13477568573	Oct 23, 2014, 12:38 AM	No	Thanks guys!! I hope so! So nervous. Were finally done working for the night.. Hopefully we don't mess up 
+19143747730	Oct 23, 2014, 12:41 AM	No	hahahaha oh connor 
+14438344406	Oct 23, 2014, 12:41 AM	No	You won't mess up...
+16174489740	Oct 23, 2014, 6:51 PM	No	Hi guys,\LF\LFCongrats again to Naomi and Georgia for a great status report! \LF\LFLast minute, I know, but we will NOT be having recitation tomorrow. Please make sure everyone is aware of this! Good luck with your project work and have a great weekend!
+16174489740	Oct 31, 2014, 11:32 AM	No	Hi guys,\LF\LFPlease prepare to give feedforward to the team, Me, Connor and Kimberly today in recitation!
+19143747730	Nov 3, 2014, 2:44 PM	No	Hey Xander, do we have mgmt recitation the wednesday before thanksgiving?
+16174489740	Nov 3, 2014, 2:45 PM	No	No we don't!
+19143747730	Nov 3, 2014, 2:46 PM	No	
+13016412364	Nov 3, 2014, 8:12 PM	No	Hey Xander, just wondering if you're almost here?
+13477568573	Nov 4, 2014, 9:13 AM	No	Hii I think the marketing committee and design committee should meet sometime before Friday since we are combining now so that we can finalize all of the designs (we can decide which design goes on which item and where we should place it on that item) and then we can give all that info to Ross and Connor so they can try to finish the website over the weekend or at least by the end of next week. We should probably also have a team meeting Sunday or Monday. Thoughts???
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 10:00 AM	No	I agree that we should finish the website early but Im scared if we make the deadline next week were gonna be rushed 
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 10:00 AM	No	I think if we make our deadline thanksgiving our final product will be better 
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 10:00 AM	No	We also have a lot more work to do slogan wise
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 10:00 AM	No	They want a bunch and so far we only have two that they really like 
+12022468481	Nov 4, 2014, 10:02 AM	No	I think we have like 3 or 4 that they said they liked in the email
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 10:02 AM	No	But Debbie at the board meeting emphasized that she wants a lot...I just don't want this deadline to make us do things less well than we could if we gave ourselves a little more time
+12022468481	Nov 4, 2014, 10:04 AM	No	I agree we should give ourselves some more time I think as well
+14438344406	Nov 4, 2014, 10:04 AM	No	Yes... I don't see the rush
+14438344406	Nov 4, 2014, 10:04 AM	No	See the need to*
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 10:04 AM	No	I agree with Georgia that we should be done before thanksgiving or by thanksgiving 
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 10:04 AM	No	But next week just seems too soon to me 
+13477568573	Nov 4, 2014, 10:06 AM	No	I just think we need a little more time to work on the client presentation given that thanksgiving is nov27th and the client presentation is dec2nd. The practice presentation is November 18th. 
+13477568573	Nov 4, 2014, 10:11 AM	No	I definitely agree we don't need to finish as early as I said but maybe we should try to be done with the website by Friday November 14th? That will give us 10 days to work both marketing and design committee to come up w more slogans as well as meet as a whole team and get the website running. we will also then have enough time to prepare our presentation 
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 10:12 AM	No	why is the practice presentation so early? thats weird
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 10:12 AM	No	anyways yeah november 14th sounds good to meeee
+13016412364	Nov 4, 2014, 11:15 AM	No	That sounds good to me also. Maybe we should ask them how many slogans they want? It doesn't make sense to me to have that many different slogans right now
+13477568573	Nov 4, 2014, 11:52 AM	No	I agree I think 3-4 is enough you don't want to confuse people. Their brand should only have a couple of slogan especially right now when they are all new at once
+19143747730	Nov 4, 2014, 11:53 AM	No	 I just hope the client agrees too...Debbie seems pretty obsessed with the idea of lots and lots of slogans hahaah 
+12022468481	Nov 4, 2014, 11:55 AM	No	Yeah but remeber in the email Georgia shared with us she said that she was fine with the ones we showed her and said she liked
+13016412364	Nov 4, 2014, 12:03 PM	No	Yeah I agree with Georgia. Companies like Nike and under armor have a lot of slogans, but I don't think it makes sense for Bianca's kids to have too many right now 
+19145254270	Nov 6, 2014, 11:40 AM	No	Hey guys, can the design committee (now including marketing) meet at some point tomorrow? I think we should meet up before the weekly update
+13477568573	Nov 6, 2014, 11:40 AM	No	Yes. Can we meet at 11am?
+19739705320	Nov 6, 2014, 11:41 AM	No	I can do before or after recitation 
+19145254270	Nov 6, 2014, 11:42 AM	No	I'm available anytime starting at 12:00 (I have class from 10-12) 
+13477568573	Nov 6, 2014, 11:49 AM	No	I have my meetig w Xander at 2:30 and a 5pm train back to NYC but I can Skype in to the meeting 
+13477568573	Nov 6, 2014, 11:51 AM	No	Andi. Can email you guys some ideas I've been working on for placement of different logos on items
+16174489740	Nov 6, 2014, 11:51 AM	No	I can happily move coffee chats around if need be
+19143747730	Nov 6, 2014, 11:52 AM	No	My coffee chat with Xander is at 2..I can do after recitation though
+16174489740	Nov 7, 2014, 1:52 AM	No	Hi guys,\LF\LFJust wanted to give you a heads up. If you felt like preparing something ahead of time, we will be giving feedforward to Kimberly, Avikar, Ross and Blair tomorrow.\LF\LFSee you all at 3 and see Naomi and Georgia in capo beforehand for our coffee chats!
+19145254270	Nov 8, 2014, 7:06 PM	No	If anyone figures out how to properly save designs on zazzle let me know! 
+19145254270	Nov 8, 2014, 7:08 PM	No	It seems to be putting everything we design in the shopping cart (rather than in a store) 
+19143747730	Nov 8, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	I tried for like 30' mins 
+19143747730	Nov 8, 2014, 7:10 PM	No	I think the problem is that the email doesn't work 
+19143747730	Nov 8, 2014, 7:12 PM	No	The verification email won't send and I think that's freezing everything 
+19145254270	Nov 8, 2014, 7:12 PM	No	That makes sense 
+13477568573	Nov 8, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	I emailed them so hopefully zazzle emails us back
+13477568573	Nov 8, 2014, 7:42 PM	No	For now just add to cart maybe? That seems like it's the only way to save it
+17344782101	Nov 8, 2014, 7:43 PM	Yes	They won't until Monday
+13477568573	Nov 10, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	Connor and Ross can you try to call them and figure out the technology stuff today so that we can work on it at our meeting  tonight? 
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 1:34 PM	Yes	Yeah
+13477568573	Nov 10, 2014, 1:35 PM	No	Thank you! 
+17344782101	Nov 10, 2014, 1:56 PM	Yes	Store is set up, unfortunately I'm not sure how to move something from saved designs to the store, I'll keep trying to figure that out but for now make sure any new designs yall do you do by clicking store, manage products, and then create new product
+16174489740	Nov 10, 2014, 1:56 PM	No	Any objections to pizza tonight at 8pm in JMHH 340? Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions
+19143747730	Nov 10, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	Definitely no objection 
+19143747730	Nov 10, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	Hahaha 
+19143747730	Nov 10, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	
+14438344406	Nov 10, 2014, 1:57 PM	No	Nope sounds good
+13477568573	Nov 10, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	Sounds good!
+19143747730	Nov 10, 2014, 2:07 PM	No	How do I move things from the shopping cart to saved designs?
+19143747730	Nov 10, 2014, 2:07 PM	No	
+14438344406	Nov 10, 2014, 2:07 PM	No	Im working on that right now lol
+14438344406	Nov 10, 2014, 2:13 PM	No	" When you post a new product for sale, it can take a while for the Zazzle site to ""catch up"", so your new products may not appear in your shop for a while. Usually, new products will show up within an hour or so, but may take longer if the site is undergoing maintenance or updates."
+14438344406	Nov 10, 2014, 2:13 PM	No	Just hit post for sale and then go from there. We have to decide the royalties before we post them though
+19143747730	Nov 10, 2014, 2:13 PM	No	Yeah I just realized that...there are officially a ton of iPhone cases in saved designs 
+19143747730	Nov 10, 2014, 2:13 PM	No	Oops
+14438344406	Nov 10, 2014, 2:13 PM	No	Yeah. Thanks.
+14438344406	Nov 10, 2014, 2:14 PM	No	
+16174489740	Nov 10, 2014, 5:38 PM	No	Hey guys, just a reminder to bring a copy of your image of leadership to class tomorrow!
+13477568573	Nov 11, 2014, 11:19 AM	No	Hii I just emailed everyone but in case you don't see it-- we need to email back nick from Bianca's kids to set up a time to teach him how to use zazzle. It is most important that we find a time when Connor and Ross can meet him. What time next week works? I think it would be helpful (and we said we would do this in the LOE) to also come with a short written out guide of how to use the website (preferably w pictures) 
+19145254270	Nov 11, 2014, 11:49 AM	No	I can help compile the written guide. We should probably have that together by the time Nick comes 
+19143747730	Nov 11, 2014, 12:21 PM	No	If Ross and Connor need help compiling the written instructions I can also help, just let me know! 
+14438344406	Nov 11, 2014, 12:33 PM	No	We have it under control. But thanks guys.
+19145254270	Nov 11, 2014, 12:34 PM	No	Sure. Let us know if u need anything else 
+13477568573	Nov 11, 2014, 12:46 PM	No	Ok perfect just let me know what to email him back (date and time and place)
+19143747730	Nov 11, 2014, 4:21 PM	No	Hey guys so regarding the next team meeting Im leaving Friday at 5 for New York so I won't be here this weekend, we definitely need to start working on our practice presentation though 
+19143747730	Nov 11, 2014, 4:22 PM	No	So it would be idea if we could start working on that as a team maybe before this weekend? But if you guys can't I can also definitely Skype in when you meet this weekend 
+19143747730	Nov 11, 2014, 4:22 PM	No	We also need to start thinking about who we want as speakers for the presentations 
+19145254270	Nov 11, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	I'm willing to be a presenter for the practice one (and let more vocal members tackle the final one) if you guys think that's a good idea 
+19145254270	Nov 11, 2014, 4:26 PM	No	We should all discuss it sometime though 
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 4:28 PM	No	We should also try and make it so that one person from each committee is presentin for the practice and client presentations
+19143747730	Nov 11, 2014, 4:30 PM	No	 Yeah that's a good point
+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 4:31 PM	Yes	Let's discuss this in person later
+13477568573	Nov 11, 2014, 5:36 PM	No	Ok when should we are we meeting as a team?
+19145254270	Nov 11, 2014, 5:41 PM	No	Before/after recitation on Friday perhaps? The design committee is meeting tomorrow 
+19145254270	Nov 11, 2014, 5:41 PM	No	Or Thursday if we want to decide sooner/if people are available 
+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 5:42 PM	Yes	Let's meet right after class on Thursday 
+13477568573	Nov 11, 2014, 5:42 PM	No	Can we do Friday before or after recitation? Maybe after since the marketing committee was supposed to meet 2-3 Friday I think but we could probably move that if the whole team wants to meet 2-3 on Friday
+19145254270	Nov 11, 2014, 5:43 PM	No	I can do that (Naomi said she's leaving at 5 I think) 
+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 5:43 PM	Yes	No, Naomi and I are both leaving
+13477568573	Nov 11, 2014, 5:44 PM	No	So 2-3 Friday? 
+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 5:45 PM	Yes	No, I'm leaving before then, let's do Thursday
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 5:49 PM	No	What time on thursday? I have class till 6:30
+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 5:51 PM	Yes	Not sure, if Friday is best for everyone then let's just do that, I probably won't be terribly involved in the practice round because I'm out of town all weekend and will not be able to work on it
+13477568573	Nov 11, 2014, 7:13 PM	No	What do I respond to nick abt a time to teach him how to use zazzle? 
+13368135007	Aug 30, 2014, 1:45 PM	No	imran
+13368135007	Aug 31, 2014, 7:24 AM	No	thanks for coming by yesterday, good to meet your friends as well. did you decide to get MiA tickets for today?

+17344782101	Aug 31, 2014, 11:51 PM	Yes	Sounds good, just a heads up I'm auditioning for a lot of groups tomorrow, I'll try to avoid scheduling anything during lunch but if that's not possible I'll let you know as soon as I do
+13368135007	Aug 31, 2014, 11:58 PM	No	ok no worries, go when you need to go and we can always reschedule - these groups won't!
+17344782101	Sep 1, 2014, 12:00 AM	Yes	Thanks for understanding man
+13368135007	Sep 1, 2014, 11:09 AM	No	we still good for lunch? bringing a couple of friends along if that's cool
+17344782101	Sep 1, 2014, 11:11 AM	Yes	Yeah, mind I Felipe tags along?

+13368135007	Sep 1, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	how were the auditions?
+17344782101	Sep 1, 2014, 8:21 PM	Yes	So so, not terribly optimistic about anything, but it was nice to see the audition process
+13368135007	Sep 2, 2014, 7:52 PM	No	that's true, you never know about things unless you take the plunge
+17344782101	Sep 12, 2014, 11:37 PM	Yes	Are you at your frat house?
+13368135007	Sep 12, 2014, 11:40 PM	No	yeah there's a great party going on - 4049 Spruce St. it's sports themed so bring some gear and friends
+17344782101	Sep 12, 2014, 11:41 PM	Yes	Haha I'm here, where are you?
+13368135007	Sep 12, 2014, 11:41 PM	No	I'll be there in 10 mins

+13368135007	Oct 4, 2014, 5:30 PM	No	Hi Connor, hope your weekend's off to a good start. We have a closed event tonight, cigars and whiskey, at 3930 Sansom at 10pm. Dress is business casual - see you there?
+17344782101	Oct 4, 2014, 6:27 PM	Yes	Sounds good, is it okay if I end up being a little late? I already committed to a byo and I'm not sure what time it's going to end
+13368135007	Oct 4, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	sure thing, I understand
+17344782101	Oct 4, 2014, 11:20 PM	Yes	Byo just ended, don't think I'm going to be able to make it tonight, little to drunk, appreciate the invite though and if possible please let me known of future events 
+13368135007	Oct 14, 2014, 8:22 AM	No	Hi Connor, we're having an event on Saturday (beer olympics) at 8pm at 4049 Spruce. think you can make it?
+17344782101	Oct 14, 2014, 6:55 PM	Yes	I'll definitely stop by for a little bit, unfortunately I'm on antibiotics for a sinus infection so I can't drink a ton this weekend
+13368135007	Oct 15, 2014, 10:14 AM	No	ah sorry to hear that, hope you're feeling better soon - see you Saturday then
+17344782101	Oct 15, 2014, 2:01 PM	Yes	Sounds good
+17344782101	Oct 18, 2014, 7:56 PM	Yes	Same house as usual?
+13368135007	Oct 18, 2014, 7:57 PM	No	yeah same one
+13368135007	Oct 18, 2014, 8:10 PM	No	my mistake, it starts at 9pm - the time got changed after I sent you the invite
+17344782101	Oct 18, 2014, 8:11 PM	Yes	Haha yeah showed up and figured that out 
+13368135007	Oct 18, 2014, 8:19 PM	No	my bad! I'll be over in about an hour
+17344782101	Oct 18, 2014, 9:48 PM	Yes	Think ima half to pass tonight, decided drinking wasn't a great idea
+13368135007	Oct 19, 2014, 11:34 AM	No	ah sorry to miss you. hope you recover soon!
+13368135007	Oct 19, 2014, 11:34 AM	No	we have a date night at the same house on Thursday night at 9pm. theme is Champagne and Shackles - think you can make it?

+17344782101	Oct 24, 2014, 10:50 AM	Yes	We both really enjoyed it, thanks man
+13368135007	Oct 27, 2014, 10:09 PM	No	Hi Connor, we have a golf night on Saturday before our party. It'll be a fun pregame - meet at 4049 Spruce at 8:30pm
+13368135007	Oct 29, 2014, 11:15 AM	No	following up
+17344782101	Oct 29, 2014, 11:19 AM	Yes	Sorry, thought I'd already responded, I should be able to make for a bit, unfortunately I've got three midterms next week
+13368135007	Oct 29, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	ok it should be 1-2 hours max, see you there. and we should grab a meal next week after your midterms to catch up
+17344782101	Oct 29, 2014, 11:41 PM	Yes	Definitely, last one ends at noon on Friday, but I'd be down to do earlier in the week if it works better
+17344782101	Nov 1, 2014, 8:45 PM	Yes	Hey I'm here
+17344782101	Aug 30, 2014, 2:08 PM	Yes	When are we all getting fucked up together?
+14438344406	Aug 30, 2014, 2:10 PM	No	Made in America anyone?
+12022468481	Aug 30, 2014, 2:12 PM	No	I'm goinggg!
+14438344406	Aug 30, 2014, 2:16 PM	No	Me too
+19143747730	Aug 30, 2014, 2:31 PM	No	Hahahaha sooooonnnn!!! 
+19143747730	Aug 30, 2014, 2:31 PM	No	I can't...going back to New York for the night 
+14438344406	Aug 31, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	I was just front row for tiesto... Fucking amazing
+12022468481	Aug 31, 2014, 11:22 PM	No	I heard it was insaneeee
+13016412364	Aug 31, 2014, 11:22 PM	No	So I had to miss tiesto in order to take care of my roommate who started puking 
+14438344406	Aug 31, 2014, 11:23 PM	No	Tiesto was amazing. Best artist I saw this weekend
+14438344406	Aug 31, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	Actually... Did any of you guys see r3hab yesterday?
+13016412364	Aug 31, 2014, 11:24 PM	No	Yeah dude and aoki 
+14438344406	Aug 31, 2014, 11:26 PM	No	R3hab was incredible if you were up front 
+13477568573	Sep 1, 2014, 11:47 AM	No	Did anyone start looking at the projects? I'm thinking Carelink Mental Health Awareness as a number one choice (need 50 attendees who are students) followed by the Delco learning center family fun day then the Philadelphia futures building your brand interactive day. Looking at the syllabus it looks like we need to chart our progress and having a certain day on which the event takes place I think will make our progress more measurable because we will have a specific end goal/day. Thoughts?? 
+12022468481	Sep 1, 2014, 11:53 AM	No	I agree.. I liked the ones that had us do a day thing because the success would be easy to see 
+17344782101	Sep 1, 2014, 11:58 AM	Yes	Agreed, on a side note I added y'all to a google doc where we could post pros and cons and ranking preferences
+19739705320	Sep 1, 2014, 12:02 PM	No	I agree with choosing projects that take place on a certain day so that the timeline is more structured. 
+19143747730	Sep 1, 2014, 12:32 PM	No	Totally agree, I haven't fine through the description of different clients yet though...I'll go through it a lil later today but that health one sounds really cool 
+19143747730	Sep 1, 2014, 12:41 PM	No	*gone
+13016412364	Sep 1, 2014, 1:11 PM	No	I agree with the health one, and I also think the online store for Bianca's kids would be good. I think Connors google doc is a great way to get our thoughts organized, so can we use that for now and then use that information to come up with our top 3?
+19143747730	Sep 1, 2014, 1:16 PM	No	
+14438344406	Sep 1, 2014, 2:20 PM	No	Is there any way for me to get on study.net without paying?
+13477568573	Sep 1, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	I added a space at the bottom of the google docs to post your own individual ratings in one format together. Then we can try to find a common top 4 so we can come to a consensus on which we absolutely all agree we do not want. Once we eliminate the projects we definitely do not want we can determine how to rank our top 4 choices 
+14438344406	Sep 1, 2014, 4:01 PM	No	We still need to rank all 8 in the end though
+19145254270	Sep 1, 2014, 4:03 PM	No	Maybe we should each rank all of the projects individually and then add up all the rankings for each one? At some point we should discuss them in person too I feel like 
+17344782101	Sep 1, 2014, 4:05 PM	Yes	We will discuss in person later this week, doc is just intended to be a starting point for discussion
+14438344406	Sep 1, 2014, 4:13 PM	No	I like Adams idea. That seems the easiest system 
+13477568573	Sep 1, 2014, 4:17 PM	No	Yea I did Adan's idea at the bottom of the google docs so out your rankings there
+13477568573	Sep 1, 2014, 5:05 PM	No	*Adam's     *put
+19145254270	Sep 1, 2014, 5:26 PM	No	Perfect, I also added a table (and partially filled it in based on what you guys wrote) 
+19143747730	Sep 1, 2014, 9:27 PM	No	guys where can i find this google doc?
+17344782101	Sep 1, 2014, 9:28 PM	Yes	You should have an email invite, if not I'll send one
+19739705320	Sep 1, 2014, 9:39 PM	No	Where are the project descriptions posted on canvas? I can't find them in files 
+19145254270	Sep 1, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	You have to go to people, then groups (wait a few seconds for it to load), select our lecture (lecture 9 I think) and then click on files. It's so complicated!
+19739705320	Sep 1, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	Ok I got it! Thanks 
+19145254270	Sep 1, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	No probs!
+13477568573	Sep 1, 2014, 9:50 PM	No	Is there something we have to do with the ten minutes to make a decision thing or do we just read it?? 
+12022468481	Sep 1, 2014, 9:55 PM	No	I'm pretty sure we just read it 
+13477568573	Sep 3, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	"How do we turn in the cascades? It says it is ""due by 11:59pm"" but how do we submit it?? "
+19143747730	Sep 3, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	Whats cascades? 
+14438344406	Sep 3, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	I'm pretty sure we don't submit it
+19739705320	Sep 3, 2014, 4:45 PM	No	It's due tomorrow so I think we hand it in in class possibly 
+19143747730	Sep 3, 2014, 4:48 PM	No	What do you have to do for it? 
+14438344406	Sep 3, 2014, 4:48 PM	No	I think what's most important is that our TA knows we have evaluated the different non profits
+19739705320	Sep 3, 2014, 4:48 PM	No	It's a worksheet, we have to read it and then there's an individual and group component. It's on study net
+14438344406	Sep 3, 2014, 4:50 PM	No	Did you guys pay for study net?
+19143747730	Sep 3, 2014, 4:50 PM	No	Alrighttt awesome thanks so muchhhh 
+19143747730	Sep 3, 2014, 4:50 PM	No	
+17344782101	Sep 3, 2014, 4:53 PM	Yes	Two of y'all still need to post rankings on the google doc
+14438344406	Sep 3, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	Yeah I gotta do that
+19143747730	Sep 3, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	yeah me too
+13477568573	Sep 3, 2014, 4:55 PM	No	I just asked Xander and he said we don't have to submit anything we just need to come to class with our own individual rankings
+14438344406	Sep 3, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	Awesome. So the google doc will be enough once we all get our rankings up there
+14438344406	Sep 3, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	?
+13477568573	Sep 3, 2014, 4:56 PM	No	I'm not positive I just know that there is nothing due electronically tonight by 11:59pm 
+13477568573	Sep 8, 2014, 4:41 PM	No	Does anyone know how to do this personality thing that is due September 11th?? I didn't get an email with the website or log in or anythig
+19145254270	Sep 8, 2014, 4:43 PM	No	I was wondering the same 
+13016412364	Sep 8, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	I just got an email about an hour ago. If you don't get it soon, I would talk to Xander cause it gives you a username and password 
+13016412364	Sep 8, 2014, 4:47 PM	No	Also the email says it's not due until the 15th
+19145254270	Sep 8, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	Just got it 
+19143747730	Sep 8, 2014, 6:50 PM	No	Haven't gotten it
+13477568573	Sep 8, 2014, 7:00 PM	No	I just got it
+13477568573	Sep 12, 2014, 11:21 AM	No	Don't forget to put your hours in the time log!
+13016412364	Sep 12, 2014, 12:59 PM	No	Do you still need help printing stuff out at 2?
+13477568573	Sep 12, 2014, 12:59 PM	No	I got it thank you! 
+19143747730	Sep 12, 2014, 1:38 PM	No	So since she has her own shipping thing 
+19143747730	Sep 12, 2014, 1:38 PM	No	Should I prepare the basic goodsie thing too? 
+17344782101	Sep 12, 2014, 1:39 PM	Yes	Yeah
+19143747730	Sep 12, 2014, 1:38 PM	No	Alright sounds good 
+19143747730	Sep 12, 2014, 1:38 PM	No	I have a printer so I'll also print it out 
+19143747730	Sep 12, 2014, 1:40 PM	No	Were meeting in the usual recitations room right? 
+13477568573	Sep 12, 2014, 1:43 PM	No	I already changed the thing so just add another column for another version of foods is
+13477568573	Sep 12, 2014, 1:43 PM	No	*goodsie
+13477568573	Sep 12, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	Put it in a diff color but one similar to the other goodsie

+13477568573	Sep 12, 2014, 1:59 PM	No	Also, during the meeting we should probably have two note takers so were not all writing everything super quickly. Anyone want to do that??
+19145254270	Sep 12, 2014, 1:59 PM	No	I'll be one of them

+14438344406	Sep 12, 2014, 2:01 PM	No	Whoever does it, it should be done on a laptop so we can easily share it
+17344782101	Sep 12, 2014, 2:06 PM	Yes	Quick question, are we ambivalent about which retail store provider we use or are we pushing for a specific one? Personally I don't care but I was wondering if anyone felt differently
+14438344406	Sep 12, 2014, 2:05 PM	No	I think we should decide based on her vision
+14438344406	Sep 12, 2014, 2:07 PM	No	We are catering to our client's needs
+19739705320	Sep 12, 2014, 2:20 PM	No	I can so it on my laptop

+14438344406	Sep 21, 2014, 8:17 PM	No	Hey can everyone post their paragraphs to the Google doc? I'd like to read all of the paragraphs before I finalize the conclusion.
+19145254270	Sep 21, 2014, 9:18 PM	No	I just wrote the design committee paragraph. Feel free to edit where ever you see fit 
+13016412364	Sep 22, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	Does anyone have anything left to add for the letter of engagement? We should email it to Xander ASAP so he can give us feedback
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 1:44 PM	No	 Yeah I'll put the conclusion in and email it to him
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 1:48 PM	No	Just so you all know Naomi and I are working on the case study and it's almost done

+19145254270	Sep 22, 2014, 7:40 PM	No	I think it's okay 
+19143747730	Sep 22, 2014, 7:49 PM	No	Does it need to be super professional?
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 7:50 PM	No	"I'm not sure... For the directions it says ""write the letter in a professional manner"""
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 8:00 PM	No	Georgia, are you going to send them weekly updates?
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 8:02 PM	No	Yes. I sent them one on Friday. I cc'd it to you all right? 
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 8:02 PM	No	Just wanted to make sure, because I put in the conclusion that you will

+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 9:59 PM	No	I'll do it Avikar. I'm gonna wait a few more minutes because Xander is stuck in a meeting, but if he's unable to get back to me in time with the final edits I'll just submit what we have
+13016412364	Sep 22, 2014, 10:00 PM	No	Sounds good

+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	On the posting thing for case study
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 10:05 PM	No	That's fine 
+17344782101	Sep 22, 2014, 10:07 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Sep 22, 2014, 10:07 PM	Yes	Meet chance the rabbit
+13016412364	Sep 22, 2014, 10:08 PM	No	Haha is that our new team mascot?
+19145254270	Sep 22, 2014, 10:08 PM	No	Is that hill?
+17344782101	Sep 22, 2014, 10:10 PM	Yes	Adam I'm not allowed to say where it is, and I wish, he's pretty damn chill
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 10:19 PM	No	^ means it's in a dorm
+19145254270	Sep 22, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	AHAHA i see 
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 10:58 PM	No	Attach a projected budget of expenses to your letter.Work with your client to see if he or she can offset some of the cost of completing your project.You can also request funds for supplies from the Penn Book Store, transportation to and from the project site, and photocopying at Campus Copy..... What should I do for this?
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	Shit
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	Maybe do budget expense for zazzle 
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	Is there a template for that?
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	Is that our only budget expense?
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	Yes I think so
+13016412364	Sep 22, 2014, 10:59 PM	No	We may need them to pay for septa tokens as well
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:00 PM	No	What's that?
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:00 PM	No	Septa tokens to go where?
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:00 PM	No	Just out something together. If need be we can edit it before the final one. But try to put something together that is official looking
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	The meeting is being moved to huntsman so they won't be paying for that
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	They are going to come to is
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	So literally just dazzle?
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	Zazzle*
+19145254270	Sep 22, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	How much tho? 
+13016412364	Sep 22, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	If we need to go there for other occasions though, do you think theyll offer to pick us up again?
+19145254270	Sep 22, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	Like doesnt dazzle just take a percentage from the sales?
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	^^^
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:01 PM	No	I think just zazzle. Maybe put an additional $100 towards potential transportation to meet with client to teach them how to use the website
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:02 PM	No	They seemed willing to come visit us whenever necessary though
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	Yea check to make sure there is no base fee for zazzle usage. Maybe make it clear on budget that zazzle does not charge you but does take a percentage of the cost
+13016412364	Sep 22, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	We can always request more money anyway right?
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	I think just budget 100 for transportation and make a note of the zazzle thing
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:03 PM	No	Other than that I think were good. It's mostly just computer stuff lol 
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:05 PM	No	100 dollars for transportation is an absolute shitload
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:05 PM	No	50? I don't know how many tutorials we will have to do
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:05 PM	No	Ill do 50
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:05 PM	No	Just make some sort of budget sheet that looks somewhat official
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:05 PM	No	And don't forgot to upload that and the letter within the next 40ish mins. 
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:07 PM	No	Yeah
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	Really good. Just one thing: What is the cost of the monthly fee? 
+19143747730	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	Yeah that sounds really good 
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	And I think you can put yes for the transportation bc they offered before
+19143747730	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	From what I researched zazzle has none
+19143747730	Sep 22, 2014, 11:12 PM	No	It's free
+19143747730	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 PM	No	Since they make money off your selling stuff they don't charge any monthly fees
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 PM	No	The website security is just referring to the hosting of biancaskids.org
+19143747730	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 PM	No	Oh ok 
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 PM	No	Oh kk maybe Say web security and hosting from web.com
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 PM	No	its necessary for that to be paid for in order for the retail store to exist
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 PM	No	So it's clear
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:14 PM	No	ok
+13477568573	Sep 22, 2014, 11:15 PM	No	Then just submit it I'm sure it's fine lol
+14438344406	Sep 22, 2014, 11:18 PM	No	Done
+19145254270	Sep 22, 2014, 11:18 PM	No	Great
+13477568573	Sep 24, 2014, 7:36 AM	No	Is someone working on the letter of engagement draft?
+13477568573	Sep 24, 2014, 7:36 AM	No	*re-draft
+13477568573	Sep 24, 2014, 7:37 AM	No	Naomi and I will edit the case study
+12022468481	Sep 24, 2014, 8:52 AM	No	I can make some edits for the draft 
+12022468481	Sep 24, 2014, 10:44 PM	No	Wait guys... Did Xander email back the loe draft with his notes?
+19145254270	Sep 24, 2014, 10:53 PM	No	If he did it wasn't sent to me 
+14438344406	Sep 25, 2014, 12:59 AM	No	Did anyone do the loe
+13477568573	Sep 25, 2014, 2:34 AM	No	I didn't get edits 
+14438344406	Sep 25, 2014, 2:38 AM	No	Is there anything on canvas?

+19143747730	Oct 7, 2014, 4:48 PM	No	
+14438344406	Oct 7, 2014, 4:48 PM	No	At the meeting tonight, Adam and I want to do head shots, so that we can include the pictures in the slides for our status report... So just keep that in mind if you care how you look in the pictures in the status report
+19143747730	Oct 7, 2014, 4:48 PM	No	Why don't you just take a picture off Facebook? 
+19143747730	Oct 7, 2014, 4:48 PM	No	It's so much simpler
+14438344406	Oct 7, 2014, 4:52 PM	No	Because I just want a headshot. And when you start photoshopping peoples heads, the photo quality gets bad
+19143747730	Oct 7, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	If we all send each other good quality already cropped pictures of each other that'll make all our lives so much easier no? 
+19143747730	Oct 7, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	That way for status reports everyone has everyone's picture 
+14438344406	Oct 7, 2014, 4:54 PM	No	Okay, if you want to that thats fine. But Im just going to take my picture tonight, and well put all of the pictures in the google folder

+18043996538	Aug 30, 2014, 10:53 PM	No	They said hopefully full swing by 12
+18043996538	Aug 30, 2014, 10:53 PM	No	They do have a back yard so I'm sure you could smoke if you wanted to

+17274667822	Aug 31, 2014, 5:10 PM	No	I'm down for coffee if you're free in the morning

+18657426388	Sep 7, 2014, 3:21 PM	No	I'm in Pennyo, the Chinese group. Haha. Not too shocking I suppose. \LF\LFWhat about you? 
+17344782101	Sep 7, 2014, 3:25 PM	Yes	Haha congrats, and dischord
+18657426388	Sep 7, 2014, 3:26 PM	No	Nice. Looking forward to hearing about it all man! I can now be the rapping Asian guy on stage next year. Haha. 
+17344782101	Sep 7, 2014, 3:29 PM	Yes	Haha awesome, every one loves the rapping Asian guy, how've classes been?
+18657426388	Sep 7, 2014, 4:01 PM	No	They've been alright. Waiting to finally get that management project and get going though. 
+17344782101	Sep 7, 2014, 4:19 PM	Yes	I feel you on that, I think a couple groups already have them to which is a little annoying
+18657426388	Sep 7, 2014, 4:30 PM	No	And it seems everyone in my cohort ranked practically the same way, so my group may get some awful project. 
+17344782101	Sep 7, 2014, 4:31 PM	Yes	That is unfortunate
+18657426388	Sep 7, 2014, 4:33 PM	No	Some of the projects are legitimately awful. They don't even have goals. There was a lady who wanted us to be friends with her students and teach them and help them sell things in a bookstore. When asked how one could be assessed, she said if she and our prof cried. 
+17344782101	Sep 7, 2014, 4:40 PM	Yes	Sounds like an interesting lady, my cohort had a little better luck, but there is one project that requires being here for thanksgiving and realistically that just isn't going to happen
+17344782101	Sep 7, 2014, 9:37 PM	Yes	Connor mounts
+12159395341	Sep 7, 2014, 9:48 PM	No	Sup bud thanks

+17344782101	Sep 21, 2014, 4:17 PM	Yes	Because I got back from the gym later than expected

+17344782101	Nov 1, 2014, 4:23 PM	Yes	Sorry I didn't make it man, I didn't go to sleep last night and I was way too tired
+12159395341	Nov 1, 2014, 5:07 PM	No	Hahaha no worries bro 
+12159395341	Nov 1, 2014, 5:07 PM	No	How was your night 
+17344782101	Nov 1, 2014, 6:59 PM	Yes	Haha pretty dull, I was just staked out in radian for most of it

+17344782101	Nov 3, 2014, 11:08 AM	Yes	Hey, I have a midterm review session from 7 to 9 on Wednesday that I need to go to, so I'll probably be a little over an hour late
+12159395341	Nov 3, 2014, 12:18 PM	No	Word. Just send me an email? 
+17344782101	Nov 3, 2014, 12:20 PM	Yes	Yeah
+17344782101	Sep 7, 2014, 9:40 PM	Yes	Connor mounts
+19084489880	Sep 21, 2014, 3:12 PM	No	Hey Connor! Alpha phi is having a date night on Friday at Dave and busters and I was wondering if you wanted to go! I asked Jon and Samay is going with Bryn. Since it's a date night I would set you up with my little if that's cool? We could make it like a mini dischord thing! 
+17344782101	Sep 21, 2014, 3:35 PM	Yes	Yeah, sounds like fun! What sorority are you in again? Also what's your littles name?
+19084489880	Sep 21, 2014, 3:37 PM	No	I'm in alpha phi! So is Bryn and Liza haha. If you want to find her on Facebook her name is Siobhan (pronounced like shiv-awn... It's a super Irish name) Aislinn 
+19084489880	Sep 21, 2014, 9:24 PM	No	Hey let me know about Friday ASAP bc I need to solidify plans 
+19084489880	Sep 21, 2014, 9:29 PM	No	Wait ah ok my little found a date. I'm sorry 
+17344782101	Sep 21, 2014, 9:34 PM	Yes	That's fine, see ya Wednesday 
+19084489880	Oct 18, 2014, 8:41 PM	No	Hey Connor. Sorry I haven't texted you all day. I've been trying to figure out what exactly to say and what exactly happened. Clearly I had wayyyy too much to drink last night. I blacked out like while we were leaving mask and wig and thought I went home but apparently that's not the case. I'm not sure of all the details from last night but I heard that I was really a bitch to you and I truly feel like shit about it. I am so sorry for anything I said or did. I know you were having a tough week and it sucks that I made it even worse. I'm kinda going through a rough time right now and I am getting help but I'm sorry that I ended up taking it out on you. I truly apologize and will do anything to make it up to you ! 
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 12:16 PM	Yes	I appreciate your apology, and am sorry to hear that things haven't been going well for you lately, would you be able to meet like 20 minutes before practice today to talk? I'll also see if Liza, Bryn or someone else is free to sit with us
+19084489880	Oct 19, 2014, 12:35 PM	No	Yes definitely 
+19084489880	Oct 19, 2014, 1:18 PM	No	Where do you want to meet ? 
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 1:23 PM	Yes	At Rodin is fine
+19084489880	Oct 19, 2014, 1:29 PM	No	Ok see you there 
+19084489880	Oct 19, 2014, 4:03 PM	No	I'm here 
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 4:04 PM	Yes	Sorry, I'm running a little late, can't find my wallet
+19084489880	Oct 19, 2014, 4:05 PM	No	No worries 
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 4:12 PM	Yes	Headed over now
+19084489880	Oct 19, 2014, 4:12 PM	No	Ok I'm in the basement 
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 4:18 PM	Yes	Okay, if you don't mind id prefer to meet in the lobby area by the pool table, or up in that table area a floor up
+19084489880	Oct 19, 2014, 4:18 PM	No	Yep I'll come up 
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 4:21 PM	Yes	Okay, almost there
+17344782101	Oct 28, 2014, 8:37 PM	Yes	Hey, just wanted to follow up about getting something in writing about what happened a few weeks ago, totally trust you and things have been going well, but I'd feel a lot better with something concrete
+19084489880	Oct 28, 2014, 8:38 PM	No	Ok sure! Do you want me to just write it up or do you want to write it up and have me sign it? 
+17344782101	Oct 28, 2014, 8:43 PM	Yes	Signed would be great if possible, again things have been going well and nothing's been awkward at all, I'll just feel better after having that
+19084489880	Oct 28, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	Ok cool. Just let me know when it's ready and I'll review and sign. I'm sure there will be nothing to review haha but just to be sure 
+19084489880	Oct 28, 2014, 8:44 PM	No	Also could you protect it well? I trust you also but I would just really prefer if people didn't know about this and if it stayed mainly between us and the few other people involved 
+17344782101	Oct 28, 2014, 8:48 PM	Yes	Of course, it's just going to sit in my safe, and sorry I actually meant written and signed by you, just a brief statement explicitly stating that you know nothing wrong happened
+19084489880	Oct 28, 2014, 8:48 PM	No	Ohhh ok got it. I'll try to write it up and sign it by tomorrow's rehearsal. I'm a bit a busy but it shouldn't take long. And ok thank you so much! 
+19084489880	Oct 28, 2014, 8:49 PM	No	Also I meant to email you. How is the song coming along ? 
+17344782101	Oct 28, 2014, 8:50 PM	Yes	Thanks, and half way done, probably going to have to pay someone to finish, didn't realize until tonight but I have three midterms and a status report next week and this weekend is going to be super unproductive
+19084489880	Oct 28, 2014, 8:51 PM	No	Ok got it! Good luck with your work 
+17344782101	Sep 7, 2014, 9:42 PM	Yes	Connor mounts

+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 12:51 PM	Yes	Hey, I'm meeting with Erin 20 minutes before practice to talk, any chance you could be there?
+18562871057	Oct 19, 2014, 1:01 PM	No	Hey I actually won't be at rehearsal today. Also, it may be more helpful to meet with her alone. If there is anything you want to tell me or anything you feel you should know about before meeting her, feel free to ask me.
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 1:16 PM	Yes	Okay, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable doing that, and other than reassurance that she knows nothing happened, there isn't really anything else I need to say/know
+18562871057	Oct 19, 2014, 1:22 PM	No	You will be alright. I know it's uncomfortable. But it's necessary. And she's not that evil...sober
+17344782101	Oct 19, 2014, 1:23 PM	Yes	Haha okay
+18562871057	Oct 19, 2014, 2:29 PM	No	What do you have going on Thursday night for dinner?

+18562871057	Oct 19, 2014, 3:10 PM	No	So we can get dinner instead of lunch on Friday ha. I have clinical at chop until like 7:30 on Thursday but after that I'm free

danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 26, 2014, 9:04 PM	No	When that one came out I hit play for the first time and passed out because all the blood that should have been flowing to my brain was flowing to my penis. Hopefully that doesnt happen again this year
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 26, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	This album is better than sex
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 26, 2014, 11:33 PM	No	Not that I would know since Ive only heard this album
+13368165198	Oct 26, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	Maybe if you weren't listening to that album you would know about sex
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 26, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	You have a very valid point that will be considered as soon as I finish masturbating to this album
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 26, 2014, 11:37 PM	No	For the 8th time
+13368165198	Oct 26, 2014, 11:41 PM	No	That's a quick turnover
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 26, 2014, 11:43 PM	No	"My mom doesn't call her Taylor Swift, she always asks about ""her daughter in law"""
+13364036025	Oct 26, 2014, 11:48 PM	No	So apparently Katelyn Butner gave up on college and dropped out
+13366959263	Oct 27, 2014, 12:04 AM	No	I think Mr Cavenaugh may have set her expectations unrealistically high so she couldn't enjoy life with anything less
+13364068233	Oct 27, 2014, 12:51 AM	No	^^
+13364068233	Oct 27, 2014, 12:51 AM	No	Where'd you hear that Avery?

+13368165198	Oct 27, 2014, 12:52 AM	No	She actually texted me the other day talking about how much she missed me and I was less than receptive
+13364036025	Oct 27, 2014, 11:19 AM	No	Okay Taylor's new album is actually dope as shit lol
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 11:20 AM	No	Yeah I know
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 11:20 AM	No	Blank space is the best

+13364068233	Oct 27, 2014, 11:23 AM	No	
+13366959263	Oct 27, 2014, 11:23 AM	No	Yeah way to Tay Tay. She's done well at experimenting with different styles and sounds
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 11:23 AM	No	Avery I'll deal with your insolence at thanksgiving 
+13364036025	Oct 27, 2014, 11:25 AM	No	
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 11:25 AM	No	You may as well check yourself into a nice room at the hospital because that's where you're headed talking like that
+13364036025	Oct 27, 2014, 11:25 AM	No	
+13366959263	Oct 27, 2014, 11:25 AM	No

danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 11:25 AM	No	Well done 
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 11:28 AM	No	There's actually not a single bad song on this album 
+13364036025	Oct 27, 2014, 11:30 AM	No	I actually agree it's really good lol
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 11:30 AM	No	Definitely the catchiest songs she's ever written, though perhaps not the most meaningful 
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 11:32 AM	No	These beats are pretty ambitious xD a lot of them sound like MikeWillMadeIt
+13364036025	Oct 27, 2014, 11:34 AM	No	Yeah that's the part that suprised me, like these beats are kinda hype lol
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 11:34 AM	No	I still want her to collaborate with A$AP Rocky and Montana of 300
+13364036025	Oct 27, 2014, 11:40 AM	No	
+13364068233	Oct 27, 2014, 11:41 AM	No	
+13364036025	Oct 27, 2014, 11:42 AM	No	She may go back to her hood name T Swizzle for that one lol
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 12:55 PM	No	I'm about to drop a sick ass fucking remix of Blank space 
+13368165198	Oct 27, 2014, 12:57 PM	No	Do it because I'm probably not going to listen to the original
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 12:59 PM	No	Please listen to blank space if you don't listen to any other song on the album
+13364036025	Oct 27, 2014, 12:59 PM	No	Yeah it's really fucking good and yeah make a dank ass remix Daniel lol
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 1:04 PM	No	I used to have a cough, but The only part of me that feels sick now is my penis - it wants to throw up whenever I see her 
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 2:17 PM	No	She ripped off Lana Del Rey for the song Avery is talking about - wildest dreams 
+13364036025	Oct 27, 2014, 6:51 PM	No	
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 27, 2014, 6:53 PM	No	Yeah she's psychotic 
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 28, 2014, 8:23 PM	No	Goals - get so cross faded that I forget that I love Taylor Swift and listen to all of her music 
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 12:16 AM	No	Dirty dan on the remix and the song has only been out for 25 hours
+13364036025	Oct 29, 2014, 12:18 AM	No	Can we hear it???
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 12:33 AM	No	^
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 12:34 AM	No	It will be finalized by tomorrow night
+13364036025	Oct 29, 2014, 12:35 AM	No	I want a finalized version tomorrow or I will cry and beat off at the same time to drown my sorrows
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 12:35 AM	No	Imagine Wish You Would Come Back but I adapted the beat to sound like shes been hanging out with MikeWIllMadeIt and I think either Im going to rap or sample another rap song
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 12:37 AM	No	Ill probably have to rap it
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 12:39 AM	No	Did I tell you guys that I won the Columbia freestyle rap cypher?!
+13364036025	Oct 29, 2014, 12:59 AM	No	
+13364068233	Oct 29, 2014, 1:13 AM	No	Fuck yea Daniel!
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 12:06 PM	No	Do you guys like nose rings?
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 12:06 PM	No	On girls*
+13364036025	Oct 29, 2014, 12:51 PM	No	Ring no, stud yes
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 12:54 PM	No	Ewwie
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 12:55 PM	No	Piercings anywhere but the  ears or tattoos on girls are unappealing to me 
+13368165198	Oct 29, 2014, 1:06 PM	No	Tattoos can be really sexy and on a slutty girl 
+13364086079	Oct 29, 2014, 1:10 PM	No	But rarely haha 
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 1:12 PM	No	Okay so I'm the outlier here. Just wanted to see what you guys thought
+13364068233	Oct 29, 2014, 1:29 PM	No	Josiah I'm kinda ambivalent on it, but I would lean more toward not liking a nose ring. A stud is fine for me. However I'd be less likely to date a girl with a nose piercing, mainly because the type of girls I would date tend to not have nose piercings, if that makes sense.
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 1:31 PM	No	I guess the girls with nose rings here are probably different from the girls with nose rings at your schools since I go to a Christian school
+13364068233	Oct 29, 2014, 1:31 PM	No	True
+13364068233	Oct 29, 2014, 1:31 PM	No	Most girls here with nose rings are pretty hipster but also smoke a lot and stuff like that
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 1:33 PM	No	Yeah lots of hipsters here. Like, 80% hipsters
+13364068233	Oct 29, 2014, 1:36 PM	No	Hahaha
+13364036025	Oct 29, 2014, 1:55 PM	No	Yeah Evans right every girl with a nose ring here smokes a lot and probably does acid 
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 2:05 PM	No	Haha yeah I guess there's definitely a cultural difference 
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 2:14 PM	No	I like acid
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 2:18 PM	No	Just not nose rings 
+13364068233	Oct 29, 2014, 2:32 PM	No	Josiah it's probably about 50% hipster here actually
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 2:53 PM	No	Hey that's pretty impressive. Go Texas!
+13364068233	Oct 29, 2014, 4:32 PM	No	Haha Austin is known as the hipster capital of Texas/the deep south
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 29, 2014, 5:00 PM	No	"""Keep Austin weird"" is the motto, right? "
+13364068233	Oct 29, 2014, 5:01 PM	No	Yea haha
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 9:08 PM	No	Sounds like Boone or Ashville to me
+13364068233	Oct 29, 2014, 10:36 PM	No	Haha yea it's a lot like that but a huge ass city 
+13366959263	Oct 29, 2014, 10:41 PM	No	So... Where's this remix Daniel was workin on?
+13364036025	Oct 29, 2014, 10:45 PM	No	^^^^^^^
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 30, 2014, 11:45 AM	No	I'm getting that picture tweeted by Taylor Swift and you will literally hear me shit myself from wherever you are
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 30, 2014, 11:49 AM	No	It will sound like an orgasm but there will also be a very wet fart with it

danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 30, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	It was my remix that did it
danielalmeidaporada@gmail.com	Oct 30, 2014, 10:54 PM	No	Don't listen to things in the bass boost folder

+19143747730	Oct 21, 2014, 9:38 PM	No	
+14438344406	Oct 21, 2014, 9:39 PM	No	
	Oct 21, 2014, 9:40 PM	Yes	
+14438344406	Oct 21, 2014, 9:41 PM	No	Whoa there cowboy
+19143747730	Oct 21, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	"Hahahaha I don't know why but the second I read Ross's ""whoa there cowboy"" I thought of how Connor complimented his butt last recitation "
+19143747730	Oct 21, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	
+12022468481	Oct 21, 2014, 9:42 PM	No	
+13477568573	Oct 24, 2014, 2:16 PM	No	Hii can each committee text me a short summary of what you did this week so that I can email Vanessa tonight??
+13477568573	Oct 24, 2014, 2:22 PM	No	Also let's set a date that the website is completed so maybe we can impress them more by actually having some proft from it. Like maybe we should try to have it up and running before thanksgiving? 
+19143747730	Oct 24, 2014, 2:23 PM	No	 Yeah I'm gonna send you that now 
+19143747730	Oct 24, 2014, 2:23 PM	No	I agree I think that's a good idea 
+14438344406	Oct 24, 2014, 2:29 PM	No	Unfortunately, tech team's work is dependent on you guys... We can say we worked on the website, but in reality we still need their PayPal info, the email that they want to associate with the store, and the password for that email (since we need to validate the email), and finally the products of the marketing & design teams in order to really get started.
+13477568573	Oct 24, 2014, 2:29 PM	No	Kk just let me know what specific info you need from them so I can ask her
+14438344406	Oct 24, 2014, 2:31 PM	No	I think all we need is the PayPal info, the email they want to associate with the store, and the password for that email (since we need to validate the account)
+13477568573	Oct 24, 2014, 2:33 PM	No	Ok perfect 
+19143747730	Oct 24, 2014, 2:52 PM	No	"Adam could you do some ""research"" regarding logo design and copy paste it into the Google doc I made"
+19143747730	Oct 24, 2014, 2:52 PM	No	It's in the shared folder
+19145254270	Oct 24, 2014, 3:03 PM	No	Sure
+19143747730	Oct 24, 2014, 3:33 PM	No	Hey guys could one of you book a GSR for me? 
+19143747730	Oct 24, 2014, 3:33 PM	No	Wait nvm 
+19145254270	Oct 24, 2014, 3:41 PM	No	Okay I've completed the research 
+13477568573	Oct 24, 2014, 3:41 PM	No	Kk I'm going to email her tonight so am I saying design committee did logo/slogan research? 
+19145254270	Oct 24, 2014, 3:41 PM	No	^^ yes 
+19143747730	Oct 24, 2014, 5:04 PM	No	You can send them the Google doc I mad
+12022468481	Oct 24, 2014, 6:59 PM	No	Hey guys can you send me and Kimberly at some point your specific hogan results 
+12022468481	Oct 25, 2014, 11:33 AM	No	Can we have your pictures as well
+19143747730	Oct 25, 2014, 11:33 AM	No	The pictures are in the shared folder
+12022468481	Oct 25, 2014, 11:38 AM	No	Oh okay found them 
+19739705320	Oct 25, 2014, 8:01 PM	No	Has anyone met with Xander? The week preview said were supposed to
+13477568573	Oct 25, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	Wait should we text him?
+19143747730	Oct 25, 2014, 8:04 PM	No	 Nope hahaha
+19143747730	Oct 25, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	The thing is we didn't have recitation Friday 
+14438344406	Oct 25, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	I think it's his responsibility?
+19143747730	Oct 25, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	The TAs probably explained it to their teams then
+19143747730	Oct 25, 2014, 8:05 PM	No	Yeah I think it is
+19145254270	Oct 25, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	I agree
+19145254270	Oct 25, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	He probs would have let us know if we had to do anything already 
+19739705320	Oct 25, 2014, 8:07 PM	No	Ok good. Maybe that thing we did at capogiro counts for it 
+19145254270	Oct 25, 2014, 8:06 PM	No	That's what it sounds like 
+14438344406	Oct 25, 2014, 8:08 PM	No	I don't think so. I think he's supposed to meet with us about our personal reflections and what we're going to do individually in the future 
+14438344406	Oct 26, 2014, 3:29 PM	No	Are we going to have someone from every team meet today?
+13477568573	Oct 26, 2014, 3:30 PM	No	We probably should meet sometime this week. I looked over what the design committee has done and the marketing committee is working a document with prices for products if everyone wants to take a look 
+13477568573	Oct 26, 2014, 3:31 PM	No	Also can everyone post the survey on their fb page we need to publicize it
+19143747730	Oct 26, 2014, 3:59 PM	No	
+19143747730	Oct 26, 2014, 3:59 PM	No	I definitely think a rep from each committee should meet though even if it's just for a quick debrief on our week's progress
+13477568573	Oct 26, 2014, 4:00 PM	No	
+19145254270	Oct 26, 2014, 5:02 PM	No	I'll meet but when?
+14438344406	Oct 26, 2014, 5:09 PM	No	I don't think it's really necessary this weekend. I think we've all been pretty busy this past weekend
+13016412364	Oct 28, 2014, 11:25 PM	No	Hey guys, can you email Connor and I your hrdq results? Were getting started on our status report. Thanks!
+17344782101	Oct 29, 2014, 12:21 AM	Yes	Also a folder with all the pictures would be great
+14438344406	Oct 29, 2014, 12:23 AM	No	Like our head shots?
+17344782101	Oct 29, 2014, 12:24 AM	Yes	Yeah
+17344782101	Oct 29, 2014, 12:27 AM	Yes	Also how do we see y'all's slides?
+12022468481	Oct 29, 2014, 9:54 AM	No	To see other peoples slides go to the discussion pages and click on each one that says first or second round status reports and other peoples slides are there 
+19143747730	Oct 29, 2014, 11:01 AM	No	There's a folder with our headshots in our shared Google doc folder 
+13016412364	Oct 29, 2014, 5:05 PM	No	Can u all please send Connor and I your hrdq? Were working right now so it'd be great to have all of them

+17344782101	Oct 29, 2014, 6:11 PM	Yes	If we could get everyone's feed back that be great

+17344782101	Oct 29, 2014, 6:24 PM	Yes	
+17344782101	Oct 29, 2014, 6:24 PM	Yes	No

+13477568573	Oct 29, 2014, 6:51 PM	No	No but you can probably quote something one of us said if you can kind of remember it

+13477568573	Nov 5, 2014, 8:35 PM	No	Hi sorry never saw this! I can't remember a specific example sorry!!
+17344782101	Nov 5, 2014, 8:36 PM	Yes	Haha there aren't any, we made one up
+13016412364	Nov 7, 2014, 2:33 PM	No	Hey guys, I booked gsr G56 for our 2 pm meeting tomorrow 
+19143747730	Nov 7, 2014, 2:33 PM	No	Awesome thank you so much!
+13477568573	Nov 8, 2014, 12:50 PM	No	Can someone bring a computer to skype me at the meeting??
+14438344406	Nov 8, 2014, 12:58 PM	No	Yeah I can
+13477568573	Nov 8, 2014, 1:27 PM	No	Kk perfect 
+13477568573	Nov 8, 2014, 1:34 PM	No	My skype name is Georgia.rothenberg28
+17344782101	Nov 8, 2014, 2:00 PM	Yes	I'm going to be a few minutes late
+17344782101	Nov 8, 2014, 7:13 PM	Yes	^ it is, we're going to need to call them, which I can do Monday 
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 12:21 PM	Yes	So, tech team has hit a bit of a snag and the team needs to make a decision, it would be optimal if the group could figure out a way to meet briefly before Im gone for the weekend. Im available from 5 to 7 and after 11 today, and from right after management tomorrow until 6:30. It is probably more important that we have this meeting than that everyone be there so whichever time works for the greatest number of people is what we should go with.
+19143747730	Nov 12, 2014, 12:22 PM	No	those times work for me
+19143747730	Nov 12, 2014, 12:22 PM	No	whats the snag?
+14438344406	Nov 12, 2014, 12:23 PM	No	We'll explain later. All of those times are good for me
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 12:23 PM	Yes	It will be easier to explain in person, everything is still on track to get finished, but there is some aesthetics issues.
+14438344406	Nov 12, 2014, 12:23 PM	No	There are*
+19145254270	Nov 12, 2014, 12:24 PM	No	Design was going to meet at 5:30 but we can meet for 30 mins and then meet with the team at 6 today if everyone is available. If not I can meet tomorrow too 
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 12:27 PM	Yes	Sounds like were going to go with 6 today then.
+13016412364	Nov 12, 2014, 12:27 PM	No	I'm free at 6:30. After 11 works also 
+19739705320	Nov 12, 2014, 12:28 PM	No	That's fine
+14438344406	Nov 12, 2014, 12:28 PM	No	I had an idea for the design committee that would greatly impress our client (without too much work I think). We could make some new slogans for future use, and marketing could do some research on how often big companies release new slogans (or at least just some preliminary findings), and then we could present our client with a gameplan of the implementation of new slogans in the future, giving them timeframes of when it would be appropriate to release new ones and how many they could release. I don't think that would be too much work, and it might really impress our client
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 12:31 PM	Yes	Avi just head over to wherever were meeting when you can, Adam, Im assuming yall have a gar?
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 12:31 PM	Yes	gsr*
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 12:31 PM	No	I'm in NYC having surgery so I don't think I'll be able to make it or skype. I just finished the first surgery but I have another at 4:30 
+19143747730	Nov 12, 2014, 12:31 PM	No	F47
+19145254270	Nov 12, 2014, 12:31 PM	No	from 5:30 to 6:30
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 12:31 PM	No	When is this meeting
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 12:33 PM	Yes	Okay, 30 minutes should be fine
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 12:33 PM	No	Can someone take notes during the meetig or fill me in tomorrow? I can meet tomorrow or Friday or anytime this weekend just today is really busy for me 
+14438344406	Nov 12, 2014, 12:35 PM	No	Don't worry, we'll fill you in. 
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 12:36 PM	No	Ok thank you. Can we also have a meeting this weekend? I know naom had Connor you're away but maybe you guys can skype in or we can send you notes

+19143747730	Nov 12, 2014, 2:53 PM	No	just let me know when you guys wanna meet
+19143747730	Nov 12, 2014, 2:53 PM	No	
+12022468481	Nov 12, 2014, 3:22 PM	No	Okay so what exactly is the plan?
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 3:22 PM	Yes	The plan is to meet at 6 in the gar
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 3:22 PM	Yes	gsr
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:22 PM	No	For the second meeting: can we meet Saturday morning or afternoon as well?

+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:22 PM	No	Ok perfect. So let's try for 1pm Saturday? 
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:24 PM	No	Also please text or email me what time you prefer between 10am and 2pm for next Friday meeting w nick 
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:25 PM	No	Preferably 10:30 to 11:30 on Friday with nick if that works
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:25 PM	No	Not everyone needs to attends just one person from each committee minimum I think 
+12022468481	Nov 12, 2014, 3:26 PM	No	Yeah I have class during that time 
+19143747730	Nov 12, 2014, 3:26 PM	No	wait so the meeting with nick isnt only with the tech team?
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 3:26 PM	Yes	I need to be at the meeting with nick

+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:26 PM	No	I think it would be good if ine member from design and one from marketing went
+14438344406	Nov 12, 2014, 3:26 PM	No	Honestly, thats not even important. We just need both members of the tech committee, and probably you georgia, but thats it
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 3:27 PM	Yes	^ agreed
+19143747730	Nov 12, 2014, 3:27 PM	No	I can definitely go Im just confused as to what role i would play there
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:27 PM	No	Ok Connor can you do 10:30 to 11:30
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 3:27 PM	Yes	class from 11 to 12
+14438344406	Nov 12, 2014, 3:27 PM	No	Exactly naomi. In reality, were just giving him a tutorial as to how to use Zazzle, nothing more
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:27 PM	No	Idk up to ou if you want to come Naomi and anyone else who is free. Ok can we do 10-11? 
+14438344406	Nov 12, 2014, 3:28 PM	No	I can do that
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:28 PM	No	Connor?
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 3:28 PM	Yes	Haha depends where we are meeting

+19143747730	Nov 12, 2014, 3:30 PM	No	If you guys think we need a representative for each committee I can definitely be there 
+19143747730	Nov 12, 2014, 3:30 PM	No	Do I need to do/ prepare anything? 
+14438344406	Nov 12, 2014, 3:32 PM	No	I dont think we need a representative from each committee at all. Were not presenting to the client, only teaching him to use the website.
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 3:33 PM	Yes	Im not sure we need that many people to be at the meeting with Nick. The tech team is going to have quite a bit of teaching to do so Im not sure that there is room for much else.
+19145254270	Nov 12, 2014, 3:33 PM	No	1 is fine with me for the Saturday meeting 
+13477568573	Nov 12, 2014, 3:33 PM	No	Ok perfect Connor and Ross just make sure to have something written w pictures as well

+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 11:47 PM	Yes	I think we should get a ct point back
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 11:47 PM	No	How
+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 11:49 PM	Yes	When you're sober read the criticism, Xander explicitly stated how to get the fourth point and we did that, then they changed it 
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 11:53 PM	No	Yeah I agree
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 11:53 PM	No	We answered the why
+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 11:57 PM	Yes	You want to bring it up? I'm not exactly on great terms with Xander and dinunzio 
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 11:58 PM	No	Haha if u want to. I'm fine with my score but I'm fine finding out what we could've done better 
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 11:58 PM	No	I thought we addressed critical thinking pretty well 
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 11:58 PM	No	Like we specifically said why our team would accept our changes 
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 11:58 PM	No	I'm also very drunk right now fyi 
+17344782101	Nov 11, 2014, 11:59 PM	Yes	Yup, and haha yeah, that's why I prefaced with when you are sober
+13016412364	Nov 11, 2014, 11:59 PM	No	Oh shit totally missed that 
+13016412364	Nov 12, 2014, 12:00 AM	No	Yeah I'll read it when I'm sober 
+13016412364	Nov 12, 2014, 12:00 AM	No	It seems odd though considering Xander told us where we'd lose point potentially and we address it
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 12:10 AM	Yes	Yeah it's kind of bullshit
+17344782101	Nov 12, 2014, 12:11 AM	Yes	"I'm pretty sure I explicitly state ""our team will want to do this because..."" So ima review the film and try to find that"

+13367451259	Nov 10, 2014, 3:47 PM	No	Fun fact.. To lose a pound a week, you have to have 500 caloric deficit a day... 3500 a week. You can lose up to 2 lbs a week with healthy calories and consistent medium intensity with the same caloric intake
